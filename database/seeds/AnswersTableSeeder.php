I do not directly reference texts, since I can\'t find any peer-reviewed work that *directly* references the transition in perception from "forage plant" to "weed" for *Taraxacum* spp.  
A legitimate **short answer** is simple: the dandelion (*Taraxacum* genus, but most often *T. officinale* in N. America) is *not* known as "nothing more than a pesky weed." You can find it in spring mixes in N. American grocery stores, some people still cultivate it for various reasons, and some people still forage for it in the spring when the leaves are best used in salads. 

The **slightly longer answer** is: many Americans and Canadians (and likely other folk as well) now buy most of their food from grocery stores rather than produce (or collect) their own. In cultures where foraging is still commonly practiced (like my native Southern Appalachia), dandelion greens are collected in the spring along with other delicacies (such as ramps, poke salat, scallions, *Morchella* spp. or morels, chicory, and about a gazillion more). For most others, who don\'t forage *any* foods at all, dandelions have become a pest in lawns. Even though many people might eat dandelion leaves in restaurants or in prepackaged greens from a grocery, they don\'t recognize what they are eating (and those are generally farmed rather than foraged). *Because dandelions were introduced (or invasive) species to the Americas, and because they are often not where people want them (i.e., in the middle of your front lawn), they have been recently classified as weeds.* There are a couple of non-dandelion-specific reasons for this.

1. The urbanization of the population of western nations means that *most* people now have a different relationship to plants than their ancestors did, say, 150 or more years ago. Industrialization clearly plays a role in this, as does increased wealth. Foraging as a common subsistence activity has become more and more rare in the first world, and is mostly a *cultural* rather than necessary economic practice in N. America. Native peoples and some other groups ("back to the earthers," amateur mycologists, foodies, etc.) are either still foraging or *learning* to forage.

2. With increasing wealth in the 20th C., and especially since the end of WWII, the rise of "suburbanization" has meant that many people now have *lawns* (something that in the 19th C. and before was a luxury of the ultra-wealthy). While a dandelion in a non-agricultural field is still considered to be not a weed (*Taraxacum* is not on any US noxious weed lists I\'m aware of), if it interferes with the growth of a crop or the growth of a pretty lawn, many people would then consider it a weed. The same is true of other generally benign plants (various wild roses, wild lettuces from *Lactuca*, milkweed species, etc.): they are often highly desirable in certain contexts ("natural" settings), but pests when they are "in the wrong place" (cropland or your yard). This is complicated by the next piece of background:

3. "Weeds" often evolve to mimic or live *among* cultivated species. This can easily be seen in Western N. America, where invasive grasses like *Bromus tectorum* (Cheatgrass) have evolved to live quite happily in wheat fields, where humans conveniently collect their seed, spread it far and wide, and replant it all over the world  (which is how it got to N. America in the first place in the 19th C.). In the case of *Taraxacum* spp., the advent of lawn mowers and home use of herbicides has selected for ever more irritating lawn-invaders (which grow lower to the ground, are herbicide resistant, can make many flower-bearing stems per rosette per year, etc.). It\'s very much like the classic "Red Queen" evolutionary story, with *Taraxacum* becoming "lawn parasites" thanks to environmental pressures provided by humans.

4. Post WWII, the wide availability of chemicals for home-use (fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides) meant that lawn-care companies and chemical manufacturers had (and still have) a financial stake in promoting the perception that "anything not intentionally planted in your yard is weeds." Thusly, "Weed and Feed" products specifically targeting *Taraxacum* and other common broadleaf plants are a hot-ticket this time of year in N. America. You can find pictures of dandelions on many, many bags of chemicals in hardware stores, feed stores, and groceries in almost all urban and rural areas of the US and Canada.

**tl;dr**: Very few people intentionally eat dandelion greens these days (although that is changing), and fewer still intentionally forage (or cultivate) them. Lawns have become popular for various reasons (symbol of wealth, fun for the kids, etc.), and dandelions tend to get in the way of (many) homeowners\' obsession with grasses. Home lawn-care companies and chemical manufacturers have done their best (quite successfully) to paint the dandelion as a target for an array of products. 

**N.B.s** Although the "popular" perception of the Dandelion is that it is an invader of N. America, the USDA now recognizes a native subspecies of *T. officnale* in the western and arctic regions of N. America. It is one of most widespread plant genera on the planet. There are *a lot of different species, subspecies, and hybrids of Taraxacum*. I have no idea how the Europeans perceive the dandelion now, although in the past it was considered a valuable medicinal and forage plant, which is how my (mostly Welsh) ancestors knew about the plant and managed to pass that knowledge along to us (by making us go out and pick baskets of the stuff every spring). 



*Why I\'m qualified to answer the question*: I\'m trained as a plant and fungal ecologist, and now work as social-ecological scientist (studying the intersection of human and "natural" systems, with an emphasis on hysteresis effects and plant-human interactions). Hysteresis effects, in ecology, are when past events (often human actions) have persistent, and often dramatic, effects on the current state of a system. Changes in *human culture* can be legitimate causes of hysteresis effects as much as biophysical, geological, or agricultural events. Before getting my PhD in ecology, I taught natural history courses in an Appalachian Studies department at an eastern University, and we would often discuss the *oral* history (and knowledge) of forage plants, weeds, and the changing relationship of humans to the environment. I\'ve also read a fair amount of "environmental history," especially the literature devoted to the relationship of humans to plants through time.

It&amp;#39;s distinctive and you can&amp;#39;t miss it in the fields of green where everything else is still blooming and growing. &lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This does two things:&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plant dries out and is often a carrier for wild land fires, eliminating its competitors since cheat grass is an extremely well adapted plant to disturbance. &lt;\\/p&gt;&lt;\\/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seed heads are produced much faster than other plants. If you haven&amp;#39;t experienced cheat grass seed heads, you&amp;#39;re missing out on a fun filled adventure that may make you throw out a pair of shoes. &lt;\\/p&gt;&lt;\\/li&gt;\\n&lt;\\/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also a common belief among ranchers that cheat grass has no nutritional value to their animals. This might be due to the unpalatable-ness of the plant with the seeds still on it. It can still be grazed after the seeds have gone, but it&amp;#39;s noticeable since it is ignored in the early season by animals that have better choices available. So cheat also refers to the belief that the grass &amp;quot;cheats&amp;quot; the animals out of nutrition.  &lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/div&gt;","stickied":false,"subreddit_type":"public","can_gild":false,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"\\/r\\/AskHistorians\\/comments\\/6f7hnk\\/how_did_the_dandelion_an_edible_and_remarkably\\/dihhzj8\\/","num_reports":null,"name":"t1_dihhzj8","created":1496701649,"subreddit":"AskHistorians","author_flair_text":null,"collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\\/AskHistorians","ups":12,"depth":4,"author_flair_background_color":"","mod_reports":[],"mod_note":null,"distinguished":null}},{"kind":"more","data":{"count":1,"name":"t1_dih2lnw","id":"dih2lnw","parent_id":"t1_digq1i0","depth":4,"children":["dih2lnw"]}}],"after":null,"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"digq1i0","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"the_ocalhoun","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1496620787,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_digm9p0","score":51,"author_fullname":"t2_j8jxl","approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"So... why would farmers be upset about getting cheatgrass if they can harvest it and sell it just the same as wheat?

They grow *anywhere*, and can be incredibly destructive plants when they push up through paving or have their roots crack through walls.

They\'re regarded as a food or medicinal plant through recorded history, though never as a particularly desirable one. Abū Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariyyā al-Rāzī, known in the west as Rhazes, wrote about them around 900CE, but only as a medicinal plant, and Avicenna (Ibn Sina) reputedly devoted an entire chapter to them in one work a century later. As far as I can tell, though, they\'re not included by Al-Warraq in his cookery book in Baghdad, roughly contemporaneous with Ibn Sina (at least, I can\'t find any reference to them under the names I know, and the translator of the edition I have, Nawal Nasrallah, hasn\'t included them in the index of ingredients). They were almost certainly included in the range of green plants used by European medieval peasants in pottages, although, again, they\'re not actually included in any of the lists provided by Peter Brears in *Cooking and Dining in Medieval England*.

The Victorians seem to have made more use of the dandelion. E. Lewis Sturtevant, writing in 1886, notes it grown for the Boston market in 1836, and he says the seed is for sale in "various seed catalogues of 1885" in no less than 6 varieties. The first mention of dandelion as a vegetable he could find in England was 1846 in the Gardeners\' Chronicle, where it\'s described as "a beautiful and delicate blanched salad". He also says "[t]he influence of rich soil and protected growth upon the dandelion is to give increased size and succulence to the plant, and to thicken the branching of the leaves", which is in line with most cultivated versions of wild plants. There was considerable interest in the Victorian era in new and exotic vegetables, much as there is now, and if they could be got by cultivating wild plants, so much the better.

However, dandelions, once grown, can be very hard to remove from a given location. The taproot - which is edible too - can go down a metre without much difficulty, and unless it\'s pulled out entirely, the plant will regrow from it. This is a feature if you\'re harvesting it, since it\'ll reappear within weeks, but if you\'re trying to clear it from a bed to make way for something else, it\'s a pain. This is probably one of the two reasons that it\'s not really grown for food anymore - the other being that it\'s not terribly good. Arugula, or rocket, is generally better tasting than the leaf. The flowers *can* be made into a hedgerow wine, but you generally need to add other things (lemons, for example) to get anything that tastes palatable. The root can be dried, roasted, and ground to make a drink that is claimed to be like coffee, presumably by people who have never had coffee - but actual coffee, or even chicory, is better. And so forth. By 1911, the Britannica says, somewhat delicately, "[f]or the purposes formerly recognized taraxacum is now never used". In addition, the difference between the cultivated and the wild dandelion isn\'t really enough to merit growing it deliberately.

They\'re not the only vegetable to disappear from modern use through inconvenience - there\'s one called skirrets, which resembles carrots and parsnips, but has a bunch of longer, thinner roots, which are obviously more difficult to peel and cook than their fatter cousins, so they\'ve been left behind. Likewise, alexanders, a leafy green, is more bitter and requires more cooking than celery, its closest modern equivalent, so it\'s been abandoned as well. I haven\'t eaten skirrits (yet), but I can assure you that alexanders taste like freshly cut hedgerow smells.

They\'re not _completely_ absent from modern cuisine, although they always seem to come with caveats. Harold McGee notes that it\'s \'occasionally grown on a small scale\'. They\'re used in a traditional English soft drink called Dandelion &amp; Burdock, which is still made (a brand called Fentimans is the one I know). There is a claim in various articles that a local variety called \'koproradiko\' or \'mari\' is eaten in Crete as a salad ingredient, or boiled, but it occurs in so many places with exactly the same phrasing that I suspect it\'s copied from a single source, and I can\'t find anything to back it up. They\'re eaten in Greece in general, though, as one of many plants under the label \'horta\', and are known there as \'radikia\'. \'Horta vrasta\', which seems to be literally \'boiled greens\' is possibly the most authentically historical way to eat them. Blanched leaves (grown under cover) are sometimes seen in salads in vegetarian restaurants here in Ireland, too, and they\'re occasionally used in French cuisine.

First, in terms of the Great Depression, they&amp;#39;re one of the generally disregarded products of the Columbian Exchange - there are some varieties of dandelion or closely related plants native to North America, but the ones you&amp;#39;d generally recognise are Old World imports. It&amp;#39;s not clear whether they were intentionally imported or not, but given their seeding habits, the chances are good that they were accidental. They grow &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt;, and can be incredibly destructive plants when they push up through paving or have their roots crack through walls.&lt;/p&gt;

Four different running events (including the race in armor), and the pentathalon. So I think it is a *bit* unfair to Leonidas.

The one that comes to mind is Phayllos of Kroton, who leapt so far he cleared the pit and broke his leg. As the pit was about fifteen meters long, this is well beyond the 8.9 Mike Powell managed in Barcelona. That being said, the sheer size of this leap has made plenty of people a bit leery, and it does seem to be straining against the limits of the possible, and so there is a bit of a debate over what the long jump was actually like. One possibility is that the weighted [halteres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halteres_(ancient_Greece\\)) that the athletes apparently held while jumping was used in some way to add lift or effect the center of gravity, but modern testing hasn\'t really provided a comparable effect. The simpler explanation is that it was just a triple jump, which makes 15 meters extremely impressive but well within the 18.3 meters that is the current record.

If you want to read more, Leuven has a great little site about the Olympics, I linked [Phyllos\' page](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/tp018en.html).

EDIT: it is worth noting that event athletics became proffessionalized to an extent during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There were enough places hosting games that it was possible for a talented athlete to make a comfortable living going from Games to Games and surviving off of the prize money. By contrast the competitors of the classical games were young aristocratic amateurs, so I find it pretty likely that the quality of competition was much higher in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, but authors primarily primarily talked about the classical games.',

These two sets of opposites make the bow a more widely derided weapon. Even so, its effectiveness in combat is never disparaged. There is a passage from Euripides (*Herakles* 155-164) that is often used to prove Greek disdain for archers:\\n\\n&gt; A man who has won a reputation for valor in his contests with beasts, in all else a weakling; who never carried a shield nor faced a spear, but with a bow, that coward\'s weapon, was ever ready to run away.

A man who fights in line is a slave to his weapons, and if his comrades lack courage he is slain himself through the cowardice of his neighbours, or, if he breaks his spear, he cannot defend his body from death, having only one means of defence; whereas all who are armed with the trusty bow, though they have but one weapon, yet is it the best; for a man, after discharging countless arrows, still has others with which to defend himself from death, and standing at a distance keeps off the enemy, wounding them for all their watchfulness with invisible shafts, and never exposing himself to the foe, but keeping under cover; and this is by far the wisest course in battle, to harm the enemy and keep safe oneself, independent of chance. \\n\\nIndeed, since it is very hard to learn how to use a bow effectively, there was a degree to which this weapon was exempt from stereotyping as a poor man\'s weapon. Xenophon in the *Education of Cyrus* (2.1.16-17) claims that the general use of missile weapons puts the poor at a disadvantage, since only the rich have the leisure time to train and master them:\\n\\n&gt; Now, up to this time you have been bowmen and javelin throwers, and so have we; and if you were not quite our equals in the use of these arms, there is nothing surprising about that; for you had not the leisure to practise with them that we had.

In any case, every man will have a cuirass fitted to his breast, upon his left arm a shield, such as we have all been accustomed to carry, and in his right hand a sword with which, you see, we must strike those opposed to us at such close range that we need not fear to miss our aim when we strike. In this armour, then, how could any one of us have the advantage over another except in courage?\\n\\nSince javelin throwing was still an Olympic event, the surprising thing is perhaps really that archery *wasn\'t.* There\'s plenty about the modern Olympics the ancient Greeks would find horrifying (women are allowed to watch!

Manwë was the greatest of the Valar, and to him were the Eagles dear. It is no great leap to assume that the Eagles heard much of the Song during their time with Manwë.

Gwaihir was the vassal of Thorondor, eldest of Eagles, and with his brother Landroval, an important figure in the history of the First Age. That he heard snippets of the Song from Manwë is surely incontestable, even in this darkened age.

So, when the Eagles went to Mordor to retrieve Frodo and Sam, they were already humming the music of "Hotel California". It merely took Don Henley to write down the lyrics and melody at a later date.',

Another comment mentioned specifically Virginia as their experience, and Virginia\'s Department of Education DOES have their past standards all posted in PDFS nicely organized on their website allowing us to make some direct comparisons of standards.  

For reference [Here](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/index.shtml) is the main page for the Virginia SOL\'s.  On this page are the most recent, adopted in 2008, as well as links at the bottom to previous iterations from 2001 and 1995.

Reading through the different history standards for the various grade levels did show some changes in their treatment of "legends" and "stories" in teaching history.

[The 1995 Kindergarten Standards](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/previous_years/1995/history_socialstudies/history95k-12.pdf) have as their first history standard:
&gt;  The student will understand that history relates to events and people of other times and places by
&gt;
•  identifying examples of past events in legends and historical accounts, including Paul Revere’s ride and
the  stories  of  Johnny  Appleseed,  Booker  T.  Washington, and Betsy Ross;
&gt;
•  identifying  examples  of  interesting  Americans
through exposure to biographies of important people
of the past, including George Washington, Harriet
Tubman, Abraham Lincoln, and Davy Crocket

By 2001 [The standards](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/complete/stds_history.pdf) was edited to read:
&gt; The student will recognize that history describes events and people of other times and places by 
&gt;
a) identifying examples of past events in legends, stories, and historical accounts of 
Pocahontas, George Washington, Betsy Ross, and Abraham Lincoln

And [The current version](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/next_version/stds_all_history.pdf) has:
&gt; The student will recognize that history describes events and people of other times and places by 
&gt;
a)   identifying examples of past events in legends, stories, and historical accounts of Powhatan, 
Pocahontas, George Washington, Betsy Ross, and Abraham Lincoln; 

Looking at the three versions we can see a clear shift in the 2001 standard removing what are considered the "popular myths" portion.  It is important to note that the two updated versions do still use the phrase "legends, stories, and historical accounts", which leaves a large room for error in the students not fully understanding the difference in the three.

The Virginia Department of Education also publishes a series of lesson plans for each of the grade level standards.  

In [The lesson plans for the standards US History Up to 1865](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/scope_sequence/history_socialscience_scope_sequence/2008/scopeseq_histsoc_ushist_to1865.pdf) there is a lesson (page 87 of the pdf) that covers the contributions of Thomas Paine and Patrick Henry.
The [corresponding standard](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/history_socialscience/next_version/stds_ushistory_to1865.pdf) is:
&gt; c)   describing key events and the roles of key individuals in the American Revolution, with emphasis on George Washington, Benjamin Franklin,Thomas Jefferson, and Patrick Henry; 

In this lesson the students are given links to an excerpt of *Common Sense* and a transcript of Patrick Henry\'s "Give Me Liberty" speech.  They are then instructed:
&gt;3.Have students read the excerpts individually or aloud as a class.
If some of the language is difficult for students to understand, have them look up unfamiliar vocabulary. After they have completed the readings, help them identify the main ideas, and have them complete their guided reading outlines.
&gt;
4.Have students use the information from the readings and from the textbook to write a persuasive editorial for the local newspaper explaining why colonists should support the battle for independence. Show students examples of present-day editorials from the local paper to help them understand the format and purpose of an editorial.

As a lesson on its own there is nothing overtly wrong with this; however, if we compare this to a similar lesson published by the [University of Texas](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/coretexts/_files/resources/1775%20Give%20Me%20Liberty%20discussion.pdf) we can see that UT included in their lesson the statement:
&gt;The speech you read was not recorded in contemporary sources, but was instead recounted from 
memory and reported to William Wirt (who was writing Henry’s biography) many years later in 1816.  Does the fact that Henry may not have actually said the famous words attributed to him “Give me liberty...” change the significance of this speech?  How does historical evidence change the impression we get of those who were the heroes of the American Founding?  Is it possible for the speech to be important even if we are not certain that it is accurate?  Why or why not?

The UT lesson includes an exploration into the possibility that the speech is apocryphal while the Virginia one does not; leading to students exploring the same idea with different levels of understanding.

If you explore the lesson plans for the lower grade level\'s on the Virginia DOE page many of the kindergarten lessons that accompany the standard listed above call on the teacher to find a text to read to their students that covers the event or person being discussed. As another comment already pointed out; most of the people teaching at these grade levels will not have taken many higher level history courses and may choose texts that perpetuate the myths without the teacher themselves realizing the inaccuracies.  

This issue is added to by the fact that in 2010 the Washington Post [published an article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/29/AR2010122903028.html) covering historical inaccuracies in textbooks being used in Virginia classrooms.  The texts and publisher being discussed in that article were (and still are) on the [approved textbook list](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/instruction/textbooks/history_social_science/index.shtml) published by the DOE.  The state is currently going through a new revision of textbooks but still on that site you can see that the books being discussed had to be updated to a second edition and re-approved (their works being approved in 2011) while all the other texts for the Virginia History and History to 1865 section were not put through the same process and still have their approvals from 2009.

So as a TLDR;

* Standards from when you went to school may have included such myths
* The lessons your teachers used may have omitted the historical complexity and/or possibility of the story being inaccurate
* The texts that your teachers used may have had incorrect information printed in them that your teacher was not educationally equipped to catch.

Also a big shout out to the Virginia Department of Education for putting all their standards in such an easy to navigate and locate website.  I tried Texas first to look at the transition from the TEAMS test to TAAS and then TAKS and STAAR but couldn\'t find anything like what the Virginia DOE has on the Texas DOE website.

'body' => 'Education in the US is a highly localized affair, and as a result making broad statements about what is happening in any area of classroom education is difficult. Still, we can look to the research on elementary education to help answer this question. The first issue is that elementary teachers spend on average 1 hour of instruction just dedicated to history (that is, not integrated with other subjects like English Language Arts). As a result, at best elementary students are treated to an incoherent vision of history; the lessons tend to be isolated to individual events taught without a broader context. 

Complicating this further is that most elementary teachers will have taken only one college-level history course, usually a survey of US history. They will not have learned about historiography or the historical method nor studied any one topic in great depth. Thus when they get to their own classrooms, they lack a vision for the purpose of teaching history and often report lacking the confidence to teach historical topics. As a result, what they teach comes out of what they remember learning from their own elementary educations (Darling-Hammond calls this the "apprenticeship of observation"). And what they likely remember learning are the myths of national histories (Washington and the cherry tree, Columbus discovered America, etc.). 

Finally, these trends have been accelerated since 2001. With the passing of NCLB, a greater emphasis was put on success in standardized exams. In the NCLB framework, meeting proficiency in math and English language arts was what counted as "success."  And if it\'s not tested, it\'s not likely to be taught. I\'ll offer a personal example that exemplifies this trend: for four years I ran professional development around history education for elementary teachers in NY.  When NY decided to end the 5th grade Regents exam in history, principals immediately pulled their teachers from our program, a program they hitherto praised and were excited to send their teachers to.  We repurposed our program from "Teaching NY and US History" to "Teaching Non-fiction Texts" and our numbers went right back up. The Common Core is also a set of standards in math and English language arts, so these trends are likely to continue.

In summary: history in the elementary years is not prioritized by the educational bureaucracy, likely resulting in minimal history instruction (if at all). In addition, elementary teachers lack the requisite content knowledge and/or the confidence to spend a great deal of time on historical subjects. Thus when students get to the high school years they have likely learned a great deal of history at home, in movies, in video games, etc., much may not be reliably told.

'body_html' => '&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education in the US is a highly localized affair, and as a result making broad statements about what is happening in any area of classroom education is difficult. Still, we can look to the research on elementary education to help answer this question. The first issue is that elementary teachers spend on average 1 hour of instruction just dedicated to history (that is, not integrated with other subjects like English Language Arts). As a result, at best elementary students are treated to an incoherent vision of history; the lessons tend to be isolated to individual events taught without a broader context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complicating this further is that most elementary teachers will have taken only one college-level history course, usually a survey of US history. They will not have learned about historiography or the historical method nor studied any one topic in great depth. Thus when they get to their own classrooms, they lack a vision for the purpose of teaching history and often report lacking the confidence to teach historical topics. As a result, what they teach comes out of what they remember learning from their own elementary educations (Darling-Hammond calls this the &amp;quot;apprenticeship of observation&amp;quot;). And what they likely remember learning are the myths of national histories (Washington and the cherry tree, Columbus discovered America, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;

It\'s especially important in this case because education and how-to-educate programs in the U.S. are so diverse and decentralized--one of the problems with "fixing" problems in history education has persistently been the reliance on one perspective at the policy level.

'body' => 'Ok, so let me preface this by saying that finding out something meaningful about what exactly transpired if all we have to go by are pictures is really, really difficult. Like with a single document, if we have nothing else, knowing what is going on is just... hard.

The only kind of information out there concerning these pictures specifically are a bunch of forum posts, which claim these show a US Army entertainment event but nothing about when they were taken, where they were taken, and what exactly this is. What seems to hold up going by the pictures is that the men shown in uniform are wearing US army uniforms that were issued during WWII and the Korean War.

While I was unable to find pertinent scholarship specifically concerning the culture of sexual entertainment in Korea while in the field, M. McLelland\'s *Love, Sex, and Democracy in Japan during the American Occupation*, Sarah Kovner\'s *Occupying Power: Sex Workers and Servicemen in Postwar Japan*, and Rachel Shteir\'s *Striptease: The Untold History of the Girlie Show* all make extensive mention that both during WWII, especially on the Philippines as well as in occupied Japan, the live sex show had established itself as common form of entertainment for American service men stationed there. While the general history of the live sex show is more /u/AnnalsPornographie \'s department than my own, Kovner writes that despite a lack of official reports, the sex trade and sexual entertainment flourished where American service men were present, especially since in a war torn country such as Japan, women who found themselves in desperate economic situations found that what they could sell the economically powerful occupiers was sex and there were masses of American servicemen who were after short term sexual encounters and willing to exploit the economic and power imbalances an occupation creates to get what they wanted in that regard.

The live shows differ a bit from this. As McLelland describes:

&gt; Beginning in 1947, a number of small theaters in Tokyo began to advertise "picture frame shows" that featured scantily clad women posing on stage within wooden frames in imitation of famous nudes from Western Art. (...) Capitalizing on the demand for more graphic sexual entertainment some theater owners began to offer mixed programs that interspersed short "birth control films" with live striptease

He further describes how these shows tended to become more explicit over time and developed into a form of exoticized sexual entertainment where in an almost theater-like play that took into account the various racial prejudices of American Service Men in Japan, they often embraced narratives of Japanese men failing to perform when an actor dressed as a white man would appear to perform sexual acts with the women on stage to their seeming pleasure while the "Japanese men" character was forced to walk off stage or watch in shame. These shows were not just sexual entertainment, they played to the fantasy of Americans in Japan also having defeated the enemy sexually.

What neither of these sources mention is sex shows involving white women. Shteir and McLelland go into detail about the culture of fascination with the "submissiveness" of Japanese women among American service members while Kovner mentions that there were indeed a small number of white women (she counts 13, two of them French and having gone there after the end of Japanese occupation of French Indochina) working as sex worker in occupied Japan because of how coveted their service was among US service men.

It is likely that these photos depict a live sex show that took place somewhere occupied or in the field since it is unlikely such a thing would be condoned in the States at the time. But where exactly, what the exact context is, and who the women are is, I think, impossible to find out wihtout some really really deep research. Suffice to say that live sex shows were a popular entertainment for American Service men both in and after WWII and during the Korea war.

Edited to add:

It is of course, as someone pointed out in a pm, entirely possible that this takes place in the European theater of WWII. The reason I chose to focus on the Pacific Theater and the occupation of Japan, was a.) due to the possibility that this takes place during the Korean War and b.) because the sexual politics of occupation by the US Army are much better researched for Japan than they are for the European theater. Only recently have two books appeared, one dealing with the subject explicitly, one dealing with it as part of a larger narrative of occupation and I simply do not have access to them yet.

Broadly speaking, while sexual politics of occupation in Europe had less of a racist undercurrent than in Japan, it can reasonably be assumed that similar forms of entertainment (sans overtly racist displays) were popular among US Service Men during and after WWII.

If you die, who&amp;#39;s going to know that this is a photograph of you holding your first child, or of you &lt;a href=\\"http:\\/\\/www.salon.com\\/2015\\/04\\/15\\/the_boston_marathon_and_reddit_when_the_internets_deluded_amateur_hour_detectives_ran_amok\\/\\"&gt;running away from the Boston Marathon bombing?&lt;\\/a&gt; Unless you have &lt;em&gt;documentation&lt;\\/em&gt; accompanying the photograph, something as simple as an inscription on the back of a physical copy, or caption data embedded in the image, that photograph isn&amp;#39;t going to be useful.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;#39;s dealt with family photos knows this, and so does anyone who&amp;#39;s worked in a local historical society or small-town museum. I guarantee you that right now, in a dark closet or filing cabinet at your local museum, there&amp;#39;s a vast collection of photos that no one knows what to do with because no one knows what the photograph is. &lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is why &lt;strong&gt;you must act.&lt;\\/strong&gt; Follow &lt;a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.loc.gov\\/rr\\/print\\/cataloging.html\\"&gt;the guidelines suggested by the Library of Congress&lt;\\/a&gt;. Write names, dates and places on the backs of photographs (in pencil, lightly). Embed captions in your images and store them in secure, safe locations in the cloud or physically. &lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a vast amount of information awaiting future historians, but as we&amp;#39;ve seen here, information alone isn&amp;#39;t useful. Information must be catalogued, sorted and made understandable, and the first step is documentation.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/div&gt;","stickied":false,"subreddit_type":"public","can_gild":true,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"\\/r\\/AskHistorians\\/comments\\/67rn3u\\/what_is_the_context_to_these_photos_and_was_it\\/dgt95wd\\/","num_reports":null,"name":"t1_dgt95wd","created":1493305677,"subreddit":"AskHistorians","author_flair_text":"Alaska","collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\\/AskHistorians","ups":1367,"depth":1,"author_flair_background_color":"","mod_reports":[],"mod_note":null,"distinguished":null}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","approved_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","removal_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_67rn3u","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"no_follow":false,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"dgthghg","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"floydf","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1493297435,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_dgt8t2n","score":97,"author_fullname":"t2_5cwpg","approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"Thank you so much for this.

What I don&amp;#39;t regard as part of my responsibilities is to cater to demands that reject the broader knowledge that is offered in favor of greater details of horror, gore etc.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/div&gt;","stickied":false,"subreddit_type":"public","can_gild":true,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"author_flair_text_color":"light","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"\\/r\\/AskHistorians\\/comments\\/67rn3u\\/what_is_the_context_to_these_photos_and_was_it\\/dgtmanl\\/","num_reports":null,"name":"t1_dgtmanl","created":1493332536,"subreddit":"AskHistorians","author_flair_text":"Moderator | Holocaust | Nazi Germany | Wehrmacht War Crimes","collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\\/AskHistorians","ups":175,"depth":6,"author_flair_background_color":"#003399","mod_reports":[],"mod_note":null,"distinguished":null}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","approved_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","removal_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_67rn3u","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"no_follow":false,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"dgtmfe4","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"everythingismagical","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1493303889,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_dgtjjbf","score":29,"author_fullname":"t2_ahxw5","approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"I believe you are correct in stating that historians have a responsibility to assist those with a casual interest in learning deeper truths for a given topic.

'body' => 'It\'s well established now that Mr. Kennedy had a, if you will, *boatload* of health problems for which he was heavily medicated and used adaptive technology to counteract. Official health records and Mr. Kennedy\'s medical staff confirm this, in particular his debilitating back pain. Biographers have even described a power struggle among physicians treating the president over whether more exercise or continued painkiller injections was the better option for treatment. (Spoiler alert: physical therapy).

Likewise, Arthur Schlesinger\'s (relatively) recently released interviews with Mrs. Kennedy affirm that on Inauguration Day, she took Dexadrine between the inauguration ceremony and the evening ball to get through it.

So the question is really whether Mr. Kennedy\'s medical-treatment drug useage extended to "drugs to lift you up for the event and bring you down gently afterwards", and whether Mrs. Kennedy repeated her use of an amphetamine.

The difficulty for historians is that the attention here focuses on a shady celebrity doctor named Max Jacobson, who based his treatment program, reputation, and not coincidentally income on a cocktail drug injection based around amphetamines and painkiller. The vast majority of the evidence for Mr. Kennedy\'s "off track betting" use of drugs comes from Jacobson\'s unpublished biography; he (of course) destroyed his medical records. (And not just drugs adminstered by Jacobson--he tells one anecdote of Mrs. Kennedy discovering Demerol in their bathroom and her asking *him* to convince her husband not to take it). Furthermore, Jacobson was never on the White House medical staff and does not appear among counts of official entourages for various state visits abroad.

Journalist and professor Richard Reeves (*President Kennedy: Profile of Power*) seems to be one of the few writers on the Kennedys who has actually bothered to investigate the possible veracity of Jacobson\'s claim. Here is the evidence he gathered:

* The FBI file for Jacobson asserts that Mr. Kennedy was listed as one of his patients by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
* Jacobson visited the White House 30+ times from 1961-1962 (in late \'62-\'63, Mr. Kennedy\'s official medical staff headed by George Burkley cracked down on his more freewheeling medical treatment preferences, so the timing fits)
* For a presidential trip to Vienna, Dr. and Mrs. Jacobson are listed in White House documents as booked into a room in the entourage hotel
* A memo from Mrs. Kennedy\'s social secretary notes Dr. Max Jacobson coming to visit *her*--although I\'ll note that could easily refer to a discussion about her husband\'s health rather than her own (see the Demerol story above, for example)

The Kennedy presidency was incredibly carefully stage-managed, above all by Mrs. Kennedy herself. (Who was also no slouch in the political arena, recent historiography has begun to reveal.) Sealed records, destroyed records, stigma against people with disabilities, and the eternal popularity of conspiracy theories about/involving/by/against the Kennedys complicate our ability to get a crystal clear picture. However, the evidence suggests that there was a relationship between Jacobson and the Kennedys, and it seems a fair presumption that between Jacobson and Mr. Kennedy at least it was a doctor-patient one.

As to domestic violence, I can only say that (20 year rule applied) the historiography on spousal abuse and U.S. presidents/first ladies is *extremely* sparse. Almost unbelievably so. Rumors circulated that Grover Cleveland\'s "boorish" behavior extended to battery of his wife Frances; she went on public record denying them and affirming that their marriage was basically perfect. Rachel (Mrs. Andrew) Jackson survived an abusive marriage before marrying the future president. I caution that this is referring to physical abuse rather than verbal or emotional. No, I don\'t think that\'s the whole story even with the limitations, but scholarship on first ladies is still young and largely hagiographical/biographical. I suspect this is a "stay tuned" topic for the future.',

Arithmetic was never my strong suit, but I thought it\'d be useful to quantify it against Trump\'s proposed border wall. How much of the wall will cutting these programs pay for?

**Projected cost of border wall (midrange estimate):**
$15 Billion

**Approximate length of border:**
2 thousand miles

**Approximate cost per mile of border:**
$7.5 Million

**Approximate NEA and NEH budgets combined:**
$300 Million

**Length of wall built with NEA and NEH funds:**
40 miles: 2% of the overall border

Eliminating these programs isn\'t about wasteful government spending, it\'s an attack on our shared culture, intellectual curiosity and freedom of expression.',

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approximate NEA and NEH budgets combined:&lt;/strong&gt;
$300 Million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Length of wall built with NEA and NEH funds:&lt;/strong&gt;
40 miles: 2% of the overall border&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliminating these programs isn&amp;#39;t about wasteful government spending, it&amp;#39;s an attack on our shared culture, intellectual curiosity and freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;

I took half an hour to walk out of my workplace, find a park bench, think about what I wanted to say, call, and say it. Then call again and say it again to my other senator.

Learn to flex this muscle. I make the call about once a week on whatever thing I feel passionately about. Then I reward myself by wearing a patriotic little pin that means something to me for the rest of the day.

If you really don\'t want to talk to a human being, you can call outside of business hours and leave a voice mail. It doesn\'t have to be long, and the line is specifically for people to express their opinions. So do it!

[The L.C. Bates Museum](http://www.gwh.org/lcbates/LCBatesMuseum.aspx) in [Fairfield, ME, population 6,735](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield,_Maine)

&gt;The museum includes amazing natural history exhibits, fun local history, Native American collections, rocks and minerals, fossils, outside nature trails, picnic tables, and an arboretum behind the museum.  The museum even has themed art exhibits from artists of New England each summer through fall. 

[They recieved a $5,990 grant to help with their preservation goals](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=PG-251598-17):

&gt;The project is designed to turn an unused room on the museum\'s second floor into appropriate storage space for humanities objects, purchase shelving and storage supplies, train staff in storage methods, store the project collections, and present a public workshop on Storage Management in a Small Museum.

[Appalshop, Inc.](https://www.appalshop.org/) in [Whitesburg, Kentucky, population 2,139](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitesburg,_Kentucky):

&gt;Since 1969, Appalshop has been enacting cultural organizing and place-based media, arts and education to document the life, celebrate the culture, and voice the concerns of people living in Appalachia and rural America.

They got a [$12,000 grant](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=PY-253110-17) for a cultural history project titled "The Hills Remember: Preserving Heritage in an Appalachian Coal Community":

&gt;Building on a sense of place that is deeper than its Appalachian coal seams while confronting the limits of a fossil fuel based economy, Letcher County, Kentucky, is in a moment of transition. The proposed project will build upon local efforts to increase sense of agency and appreciation for the community\'s heritage and assets. It will result in the digitization of vernacular photographic materials, artwork and  3-Dimensional objects, historical paper records and audiovisual materials provided by members of the public and gathered as a result of community engagement, public programming, and digitization events. By catalyzing the area\'s cultural assets, the project will increase local capacity through activities that safeguard and celebrate both the archival materials collected and the wellspring of community expression and traditions.

&gt;The Rockingham Free Public Library seeks to rehouse and properly store components of its extensive and popular Cataloged Photograph Collection. This collection contains photographic material from the 1860s-1970s and has provided visual information to support historic research on a broad range of topics of both local and national significance. Funds from The National Endowment for the Humanities Preservation Assistant Grant will support the rehousing training and purchase of archivally sound housing materials for the collection’s glass plate negatives and the purchase of a flat file to house larger format photographic prints. The furniture and rehousing activities would support the goal of a stable storage environment for the Library’s most popular local history collection.

The [Yellowstone Gateway Museum of Park County](http://yellowstonegatewaymuseum.org/), in [Livingston, Montana, population 7,044](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingston,_Montana):

&gt;The Yellowstone Gateway Museum of Park County’s mission is to collect, preserve, and interpret the cultural and natural history of Park County, Montana and its relationship to Yellowstone Park for the education of everyone.  

They got [$5,102](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=PG-52585-15) for "Archival/Photo Collection Preservation Project":

&gt;The Yellowstone Gateway Museum of Park County (YGM) holds numerous significant manuscript, archival and photograph collections. Collections are held to preserve Park County and Montana’s heritage. YGM honors the spirit of Montana’s history by accessioning, processing, and making accessible archival materials that reflect the state’s diverse cultural background. Currently a large majority of these collections are located in a storage building behind the museum. The building does not have any environmental controls such as heating or cooling. Historic documents and photographs received by donors are currently stored in acidic boxes. As with many small museums, a large amount of backlog exists from the early years of development. Our goal is to move the material to the HVAC-controlled museum and store significant photographs and documents in archival folders, boxes, and cabinets to ensure the stability of the items for current and future researchers.

Hopefully this helps to illustrate the kind of work that these grants can do. They are often very small, and they go to help small organizations which likely couldn\'t do the work that they aim to, or at least not on the same scale, without the help. All the grants are searchable [online](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx). I would certainly love to see people search through and share ones that have affected them!',

This resource includes books, photographs, archival records, and personal papers documenting the history of northeastern Michigan&amp;#39;s lumbering industry, maritime culture, Native American experiences, and built environment and is actively used by professional researchers and the general public.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Funding is requested for supplies to preserve items in the Alpena History collection and make them available for public and scholarly research. Materials requested include a cabinet for microfilm, storage boxes, folders, sleeves and other preservation and conservation items. These materials will protect the wide ranging items in the collection and will allow us to make them accessible to researchers, local residents, and students. Staff have extensive training and experience rehousing collections, and will use this expertise to ensure that all materials are appropriately preserved.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t used that archive for my research (my town is too young and too far north to have a lot of slavery-related happenings) but I&amp;#39;ve ended up there all the same. Last fall my father was curious about a plane crash after seeing an anniversary report on the news. We went in and within five minutes we had:&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;1) Found the proper microfilm (in the kind of cabinet mentioned in the grant)&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;2) Found out from the staff that we didn&amp;#39;t need it because they keep clippings of aviation disasters.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;3) Had said staff put us in a lovely little reading room with one of those gray archive boxes you see in the documentaries (and mentioned in the grant), with the clippings inside&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I also make frequent use of the NEH&amp;#39;s digitization of historical newspapers, which are relevant to my normal interests. Two of the most important papers in territorial Kansas are scanned in full (bar a few missing pages) and available for free online.

I\'m an immigrant to the US and after 10 long years of effort, I\'ll finally be able to apply for my citizenship later this year. I now want to do what I never had the opportunity to do back in my home country: speak out and have a non-zero chance of being heard

There are a number of things I\'ve wanted to speak up about but this post has been the tipping point for me. I\'m educating myself on the proper way to contact my representative but I wanted advice from the more experienced among us on the best possible way so here are my questions:

- When I hear contact my congressman, does that mean I should contact my Representative, or Senator, or both? 

- Am I even eligible to contact my representative? I\'m a permanent resident but as I mentioned there will still be some time before I can apply for citizenship. Should I wait? Should I mention my status on call?

- What is the best possible way of ensuring that you get heard? Online sources say email but this post says phone. Both?

- If I contact by phone, I face a new set of challanges. English is not my first language and although I\'m pretty comfortable with it, I do notice I get stuck explaining myself properly in speech. I\'m also pretty introverted by nature and I know that will make things difficult as well. I don\'t want to just read a prepared statement if I have to but any advice regarding length and depth of my call would be very helpful

- Can I call/email repeatedly and regularly? I wouldn\'t want to get blacklisted or anything?',

The latest numbers I could easily find (2011) indicated that CPB\'s contribution to PBS and PBS stations (which are largely independent public TV stations that carry PBS programming, local programming, other public TV sources such as BBC, etc.) were $71 million and $210 million (distributed somehow over the 1400 or so public TV stations across the US).  During 2010, their revenue was around $570M, so assuming 2010 and 2011 are directly comparable, CPB was paying for about 12% of PBS\'s budget.  

Another big chunk of PBS\'s revenues would of course be fees from all the local stations so they can run PBS content.  

W/r/t NPR: NRP gets a very small portion of its annual revenue from CPB and it\'s not direct funding but grants, [per this page.](http://www.npr.org/about-npr/178660742/public-radio-finances)

&gt; On average, less than 1% of NPR\'s annual operating budget comes in the form of grants from CPB and federal agencies and departments.

Like PBS, NPR gets fees from public radio stations who run their content, and that\'s a majority of their funding, so any cuts to the stations themselves (which are largely locally funded) would have secondary effect on the NPR organization itself, likely one large than the 1% in grants from CPB.',

**Here are some tips:**

**Be polite:** the offices of elected officials get a ton of communication, much of it nasty, hateful and mean. The fastest way to get ignored by an elected official is to be one of the folks being rude to their staff. They\'ll just write you off as someone to be ignored.

**Be clear about what you want:** Senators/Representatives get a lot of constituent (and advocate) contact on a lot of issues. It is easy for the details of who wants what to be confused. To that end one of the first things you should say, should be something along the lines of: “I\'m calling to ask the Senator/Representative to support funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services.” 

Say it slowly and clearly so the person you are speaking with has time to write it all down. I\'d recommend you say it again at the end of the phone call.

**Be clear about why you want it:** The best argument for a program, is to tell them why it matters to you. The more personal the better. Maybe the NEA sponsored a great art instillation in your city, maybe the National Endowment for Humanities put on a great program you went to. The point is to humanize these programs, these offices hear about an alphabet soup of programs and are drowning in data, the more you can make a program\'s value clear in immediate human terms, the better.

**Ask for a response:** Most of the time the person you talk to will be an intern or a staff assistant, they won\'t be able to give you a clear answer on the office\'s policy. Asking for a follow up ensures that your message will move up the food chain or at least force the office to actually have to deal with your ask.

**More advanced tip:** Look to see if your representative/senator serves on the Appropriations Committee in either chamber. The Appropriations Committee is the one that makes the decisions about funding. If your representative/senator serves on the committee, it is even more important to contact their offices. If they aren\'t ask them to contact their fellow representatives/senators who are.

**Also more advanced tip:** the most effective way to get a message to an elected official is by personally asking them. Most representatives/senators hold either electronic or physical town halls. Attending one of these and asking your representative/senator personally, is the best way to get them to support your programs. 

**FAQ on the appropriations process for FY 2017 and 2018:**

**Question:** Just what is the President\'s Budget and why does it matter?

**Answer:** The president is required by law to submit a budget of his recommendations for the federal budget to Congress. Congress is not required to act on them, and often goes to great lengths to tell everyone how little they care about what the president thinks. However, like Gertrude in Hamlet they protest too much.

While dramatic programmatic changes and topline numbers in the president\'s budget often don\'t make it past the committee room, the president\'s budget also contains a ton of recommendations on what departments and agencies would like for their budgets. Those recommendations often do end up mattering. 

It\'s worth noting that there is also a political element to this. The current President is a Republican, so Congress may end up spending more time considering what he has to say than they did the previous president. 

**Q:** Wait, above there you listed both FY 2017 and 2018 up there. What gives?

**A:** Usually Congress handles only one year\'s worth of appropriations at a time. However, the Fiscal Year 2017 appropriation was never finished, so although we are like a third of the way through  FY 2017 (FY\'s run from October 1st to September 30th), Congress still needs to finish the FY 2017 appropriations.

**Q:** Yeah, about. Just how the hell does this all work?

**A:** I am so very sorry you asked. Basically annually Congress passes (or attempts to pass) 12 appropriations bills. Each funding a different set of agencies in the government. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees each have 12 subcommittees, each of which is responsible for one of the 12 bills. These bills are supposed to be passed annually before the fiscal year ends. 

**Q:** So where do these programs fit in?

**A:** the funding for NEA/NEH is controlled by the House and Senate Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittees funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are controlled by the House and Senate Subcommittees on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. If you are fortunate to have a member on either subcommittee, it is vital that you reach out to them to ask that they support these programs. You can find out who is on the relevant appropriations subcommittees on the House and Senate Appropriations Committee websites.

**Q:** Do you have a source for the stuff you just said?

'body_html' => '&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh boy an advocacy campaign. I know about these, I&amp;#39;ve helped run them and been on the receiving end of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be polite:&lt;/strong&gt; the offices of elected officials get a ton of communication, much of it nasty, hateful and mean. The fastest way to get ignored by an elected official is to be one of the folks being rude to their staff. They&amp;#39;ll just write you off as someone to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be clear about what you want:&lt;/strong&gt; Senators/Representatives get a lot of constituent (and advocate) contact on a lot of issues. It is easy for the details of who wants what to be confused. To that end one of the first things you should say, should be something along the lines of: “I&amp;#39;m calling to ask the Senator/Representative to support funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services.” &lt;/p&gt;

Or just because the USS Missouri will never be hard up for donations, that the USS Olympia be allowed to rust and sink at the dock for lack of repairs. &lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/div&gt;","stickied":false,"subreddit_type":"public","can_gild":true,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"\\/r\\/AskHistorians\\/comments\\/60gpc3\\/update_the_trump_administration_and_the_national\\/df77qn9\\/","num_reports":null,"name":"t1_df77qn9","created":1490090472,"subreddit":"AskHistorians","author_flair_text":"19th-20th Century Naval History","collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\\/AskHistorians","ups":24,"depth":1,"author_flair_background_color":"","mod_reports":[],"mod_note":null,"distinguished":null}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","approved_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","removal_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_60gpc3","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"no_follow":false,"replies":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"df7w7pp","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"TRB1783","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1490109215,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_df6zr1t","score":7,"author_fullname":"t2_68nit","approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"I have worked at two museums that operated on the verge of financial disaster.

&amp;#x200B;

What a wonderful question! I\'m going to answer this in three parts -- the first talking about autopsies and medical perception, the second about Charles II, and the third to generally talk about my approach to paleopathology and medical history.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my "mod alert" -- I am going to talk about the ever-controversial Michel Foucault (though very early Foucault). Foucault, of course, is always a controversial reference on r/AskHistorians (and in history in general). If you want to rustle some jimmies, try citing "Discipline and Punish" in this forum. That being said, it\'s more or less impossible to talk about pathological anatomy and the Paris Clinical School before referencing a very early Foucault book "The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception". As far as I\'m aware, this is the first serious study of medical perception and the postmodern concept of "the gaze" (Foucault used the French phase "le regard", which is usually translated as "clinical gaze," but the term "medical perception" used most commonly in his title I think fits bette). Foucault is interested in the dawning of the Paris Clinical School, starting in the waning days of the Ancien Regime and lasting through the Revolution and the next several decades. I\'ll actually defend Foucault\'s historiography in this case (of course, the man himself would hate that I used the word history of describe anything he did) -- the work is very well referenced, and mostly concerned with the discourse of physicians themselves. That being said, while he\'s been very influential, his historiography is overly reliant on these physicians\' own interpretations, and modern historiography (Erwin Ackerknecht, and more recently La Berge and Hannaway) has unsurprisingly revealed a far subtler picture. For example, where Foucault sees a sharp break between the classical and hypothetical curriculum of the Ancien Regime faculty and new hands-on "hospital medicine," scholars have actually looked at notes from students studying in both these regimes, and notes a more gradual shift.

&amp;#x200B;

That was quite a caveat -- but I actually take Foucault\'s philosophy of science quite seriously. So one of Foucault\'s central theses in Birth of the Clinic (expounded more in The Order of Things) is that medical perception is largely driven by unconscious assumptions about what constitutes disease and man\'s relationship to it. This is in contrast to the traditional scientific narrative that medical understanding happens gradually as more knowledge is slowly added. He would argue that these collections of unconscious assumptions (he would later label this an "episteme") in fact are not additive but replace one another.

&amp;#x200B;

So I want to talk about three different epistemes before I get to Charles II. The first is what I would call traditional Western medicine, dating back to the ancients. Simplifying quite a bit, this is the idea that human health and disease is caused by balances and imbalances in the four constituent body fluids -- blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. These body fluids are directly affected by the natural environment. Food, weather, altitude, close contacts, the alignment of the stars and planets -- all could cause changes in humors, and therefore cause disease. These has some important underlying assumptions. For example, a human organism cannot be separated from its environment. Diseases are not unique entities, but have similar causes. Treatments need to be focused on "rebalance". The psychological and the physical are fundamentally interlinked. This is the context in which the tradition of anatomy emerged -- spreading from Vesalius to become an important part of both medical education and Western art. However, there\'s no sense that DISEASE can be determined from autopsy (or even variants within humans, which is very common).  Disease, after all, lies in the four humors, and the life-bringing pneuma, both of which are obscured by death.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting in roughly the late 17th century, and dominating the 18th, you have the episteme of nosology. Think Sydenham, Cullen, Pinel. They rejected humoral explanations, which didn\'t line up with the observations they were making. Instead they reclassified human disease based on symptomology and similarity to one another. The big comparison is botany -- just like Linnaeus attempted to classify all life within a hierarchy, doctors did the same, carving out orders, classes, genus, and species (and they carved out a LOT of them). Anatomy by this time was widespread, both in medical education, and after death. The biggest example would be Morgagni, who started to notice that there were different changes after death in oragans associated with different disease states (Auenbrugger is in this tradition too, though he\'s most often associated with the next episteme).

&amp;#x200B;

Which takes us to the third episteme -- that of pathological anatomy. I could go on forever about this, but essentially doctors started to realize that certain diseases had specific changes associated with tissue types -- and that what had been thought to be multiple diseases, might be just a single disease with multi-system effects. Think Bayle, Laennec (and Auenbrugger, even though he\'s writing in the 1760s -- an example of how this is more of a framework rather than a hard and fast rule). This episteme has largely survived to the present day, though with considerable modification -- Virchow readjusted to show that the CELL, rather than tissues, was the fundamental unit of disease, and germ theory gave an incredibly important etiologic factor, and the 20th and 21st century has revealed even smaller units, such as CML, caused by the BCR-ABL translocation.

&amp;#x200B;

However, for the most part, our modern noslogy outside of psychiatry (these days the ICD-10) largely operates on these assumptions. And there are important assumptions. For example, close examination of the patient, in ways they cannot access, are now of extreme importance (back then this meant percussion and a stethoscope; now it means MRIs, PET scans, biopsies, &amp;c). These has had important implications in removing patients from their own state of health. Disease is also now freed from the metaphysical (France no longer employs astrologers and meteorologists to track outbreaks, like in the Ancien Regime). It turns out that it\'s also a fairly effective way to target treatments, hence its dominance.',

As far as I&amp;#39;m aware, this is the first serious study of medical perception and the postmodern concept of &amp;quot;the gaze&amp;quot; (Foucault used the French phase &amp;quot;le regard&amp;quot;, which is usually translated as &amp;quot;clinical gaze,&amp;quot; but the term &amp;quot;medical perception&amp;quot; used most commonly in his title I think fits bette). Foucault is interested in the dawning of the Paris Clinical School, starting in the waning days of the Ancien Regime and lasting through the Revolution and the next several decades. I&amp;#39;ll actually defend Foucault&amp;#39;s historiography in this case (of course, the man himself would hate that I used the word history of describe anything he did) -- the work is very well referenced, and mostly concerned with the discourse of physicians themselves. That being said, while he&amp;#39;s been very influential, his historiography is overly reliant on these physicians&amp;#39; own interpretations, and modern historiography (Erwin Ackerknecht, and more recently La Berge and Hannaway) has unsurprisingly revealed a far subtler picture. For example, where Foucault sees a sharp break between the classical and hypothetical curriculum of the Ancien Regime faculty and new hands-on &amp;quot;hospital medicine,&amp;quot; scholars have actually looked at notes from students studying in both these regimes, and notes a more gradual shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was quite a caveat -- but I actually take Foucault&amp;#39;s philosophy of science quite seriously. So one of Foucault&amp;#39;s central theses in Birth of the Clinic (expounded more in The Order of Things) is that medical perception is largely driven by unconscious assumptions about what constitutes disease and man&amp;#39;s relationship to it. This is in contrast to the traditional scientific narrative that medical understanding happens gradually as more knowledge is slowly added. He would argue that these collections of unconscious assumptions (he would later label this an &amp;quot;episteme&amp;quot;) in fact are not additive but replace one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I want to talk about three different epistemes before I get to Charles II. The first is what I would call traditional Western medicine, dating back to the ancients. Simplifying quite a bit, this is the idea that human health and disease is caused by balances and imbalances in the four constituent body fluids -- blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. These body fluids are directly affected by the natural environment. Food, weather, altitude, close contacts, the alignment of the stars and planets -- all could cause changes in humors, and therefore cause disease. These has some important underlying assumptions. For example, a human organism cannot be separated from its environment. Diseases are not unique entities, but have similar causes. Treatments need to be focused on &amp;quot;rebalance&amp;quot;. The psychological and the physical are fundamentally interlinked. This is the context in which the tradition of anatomy emerged -- spreading from Vesalius to become an important part of both medical education and Western art. However, there&amp;#39;s no sense that DISEASE can be determined from autopsy (or even variants within humans, which is very common).  Disease, after all, lies in the four humors, and the life-bringing pneuma, both of which are obscured by death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in roughly the late 17th century, and dominating the 18th, you have the episteme of nosology. Think Sydenham, Cullen, Pinel. They rejected humoral explanations, which didn&amp;#39;t line up with the observations they were making. Instead they reclassified human disease based on symptomology and similarity to one another. The big comparison is botany -- just like Linnaeus attempted to classify all life within a hierarchy, doctors did the same, carving out orders, classes, genus, and species (and they carved out a LOT of them). Anatomy by this time was widespread, both in medical education, and after death. The biggest example would be Morgagni, who started to notice that there were different changes after death in oragans associated with different disease states (Auenbrugger is in this tradition too, though he&amp;#39;s most often associated with the next episteme).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which takes us to the third episteme -- that of pathological anatomy. I could go on forever about this, but essentially doctors started to realize that certain diseases had specific changes associated with tissue types -- and that what had been thought to be multiple diseases, might be just a single disease with multi-system effects. Think Bayle, Laennec (and Auenbrugger, even though he&amp;#39;s writing in the 1760s -- an example of how this is more of a framework rather than a hard and fast rule). This episteme has largely survived to the present day, though with considerable modification -- Virchow readjusted to show that the CELL, rather than tissues, was the fundamental unit of disease, and germ theory gave an incredibly important etiologic factor, and the 20th and 21st century has revealed even smaller units, such as CML, caused by the BCR-ABL translocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for the most part, our modern noslogy outside of psychiatry (these days the ICD-10) largely operates on these assumptions. And there are important assumptions. For example, close examination of the patient, in ways they cannot access, are now of extreme importance (back then this meant percussion and a stethoscope; now it means MRIs, PET scans, biopsies, &amp;amp;c). These has had important implications in removing patients from their own state of health. Disease is also now freed from the metaphysical (France no longer employs astrologers and meteorologists to track outbreaks, like in the Ancien Regime). It turns out that it&amp;#39;s also a fairly effective way to target treatments, hence its dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

Carlos II died in 1700. I don\'t have ANY primary information about how or why the autopsy was performed, and none of the review articles (some of which are in Spanish) seem to have any information on that either. So I\'ll defer to someone else on why it might have been performed in early 18th century Spain.  Cerda, in (Rev M\\u00e9d Chile 2008; 136: 267-270) suggests that it was done because he was known as \\"El hechizado\\", which he translated as \\"The Bewitched\\" (and I think should be able to be translated at \\"The Cursed\\" as well). Because I don\'t have the autopsy in front of me, this is largely speculation -- but with the caveat that I\'ve read a lot of literature from this period. The \\"clinical gaze\\" of the physician who cared for Carlos -- which would likely NOT have been who performed the autopsy, I should mention -- was not looking for disease localized in specific organs. That idea would have been completely foreign to physicians of this period. And going along with that -- in later periods, the body as opened AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to catch the transition between life and death. Even in Morgagni\'s time, there could be a lag to dissection, though he was aware of the effects of putrefaction.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nInstead, he would have been looking for evidence of fundamental imbalances -- and this is speculation, of course, since my caveat above -- but even evidence that he was \\"Bewitched\\".  We have to interpret these colorful descriptions knowing full the context in which these physicians operated.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat underlying diseases did Carlos have, then, and what did he likely die from? Modern paleopathology looks at multiple sources. The first thing to know if that Carlos was considerably inbred. Alvarez et al found that the inbreeding coefficient for Charles II was 0.254 -- HIGHER than the cofficient of brother and sister, or father-daughter!

Carlos II died in 1700. I don&amp;#39;t have ANY primary information about how or why the autopsy was performed, and none of the review articles (some of which are in Spanish) seem to have any information on that either. So I&amp;#39;ll defer to someone else on why it might have been performed in early 18th century Spain.  Cerda, in (Rev M\\u00e9d Chile 2008; 136: 267-270) suggests that it was done because he was known as &amp;quot;El hechizado&amp;quot;, which he translated as &amp;quot;The Bewitched&amp;quot; (and I think should be able to be translated at &amp;quot;The Cursed&amp;quot; as well). Because I don&amp;#39;t have the autopsy in front of me, this is largely speculation -- but with the caveat that I&amp;#39;ve read a lot of literature from this period. The &amp;quot;clinical gaze&amp;quot; of the physician who cared for Carlos -- which would likely NOT have been who performed the autopsy, I should mention -- was not looking for disease localized in specific organs. That idea would have been completely foreign to physicians of this period. And going along with that -- in later periods, the body as opened AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to catch the transition between life and death. Even in Morgagni&amp;#39;s time, there could be a lag to dissection, though he was aware of the effects of putrefaction.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, he would have been looking for evidence of fundamental imbalances -- and this is speculation, of course, since my caveat above -- but even evidence that he was &amp;quot;Bewitched&amp;quot;.  We have to interpret these colorful descriptions knowing full the context in which these physicians operated.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What underlying diseases did Carlos have, then, and what did he likely die from? Modern paleopathology looks at multiple sources. The first thing to know if that Carlos was considerably inbred. Alvarez et al found that the inbreeding coefficient for Charles II was 0.254 -- HIGHER than the cofficient of brother and sister, or father-daughter!

Keep in mind I\'m not a professional or some PhD genius, just some guy who studies philosophy. \\n\\nFoucault isn\'t really interested in facts. Foucault is more interested in mechanistic understandings, as in the things that produce \'facts\'. This means a lot his stuff is what people now a days would call postmodern or in super modern terms maybe even Marxist (thanks to relativism and Marxism becoming intrinsically linked in popular political lexicon). Of course, this butts heads with what some people refer to as history. Foucault fundamentally disagrees with people who think History is a discipline about historical facts, because Foucault doesn\'t 1) think there is any value in discussing historical facts because 2) there is nothing \'true\' about a historical fact. That is to say Foucault argues that history is subjective, to an extent. I\'m not saying he\'s going around saying that history doesn\'t exist or any sort of absurd conclusion like that. I am saying he would disagree with the notion that the historical fact reported is necessarily the historical fact as it occurred. I\'ll explain this further because it seems absurd. \\n\\nFor instance, take a look at \\/u\\/Bedsiderounds recap of Foucault\'s \\"The Birth of the Clinic\\". In Foucaldian terms the doctors are determining the result, to an extent, by bringing in their gaze. This is really expanded upon if you read the rest of Foucault because this notion is really the underpinning of all of his work--it\'s about power and apparatuses of power that shape every aspect of being. And it\'s clear to see in \\"The Birth of the Clinic\\" as a really defined, less abstract example of what he writes about in say, \\"Discipline and Power\\", although they are ostensibly talking about the same mechanism just in a different sense. \\n\\nSo he is controversial because there are people who read this and thinks its postmodern bullshit, doesn\'t make any sense, everything is relative and truth doesn\'t exist. But that isn\'t what Foucault is saying, it just seems like that is what he is saying when you get the overview (which I realize I am doing a horrible job at giving his nuanced and subtle view in this, the way I\'m writing it makes it seem like that is what he says but I promise you it isn\'t) I think it\'s also important to note that really modern (I mean in the last 5-10 years) psychology, anthropology, sociology, and to a slightly lesser extent (more so because it reformed later than the others) economics really actually reinforces what Foucault is talking about. The problem with that in history, in particular, is it almost necessitates revisionist History, which you likely see the problem with in an historical sub. \\n\\nContrast that with what most people consider truth bearing in something of a Popperian sense (fallibility, empirical testability) and that is traditionally what most historians see as truth bearing. Though in my experience that is also rapidly changing in the academic sphere. \\n\\n\\/u\\/Bedsiderounds mentioned Kuhn beside Foucault, which I think is a good compliment to understand the controversy. If anyone is familiar with Kuhn he moved on from Popper and offered paradigm shifts in his philosophy of science. Foucault is like the ultimate extension of Kuhn: okay, we know there are going to be these paradigm shifts, so it isn\'t important to know the facts, it is important to know the shift. It is more important to know the mechanism that makes the fact true, because the mechanism doesn\'t change but the fact does. \\n\\nAgain, disclaimer in that I\'m just some guy. \\n\\nEdit: I\'ll try to contextualize this a little better, even though I know I shouldn\'t because I have work to do. In history there is a lively debate about what, exactly \'history\' is. Is it the history of states of affairs, of events, etc or is it the study of people? This is a huge point of contention within the discipline. Foucault would history as a study of people makes sense, but history as a study of events and the more \\"objective\\" things is patently absurd because the people reporting those things have these influences of power on them, colouring the way it is perceived and reported. So you can study the people reporting the events, but you can\'t really study the events themselves. Of course this is a simplification and dilution but I believe it to be the jist of the controversy.

Though in my experience that is also rapidly changing in the academic sphere. &lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\\"\\/u\\/Bedsiderounds\\"&gt;\\/u\\/Bedsiderounds&lt;\\/a&gt; mentioned Kuhn beside Foucault, which I think is a good compliment to understand the controversy. If anyone is familiar with Kuhn he moved on from Popper and offered paradigm shifts in his philosophy of science. Foucault is like the ultimate extension of Kuhn: okay, we know there are going to be these paradigm shifts, so it isn&amp;#39;t important to know the facts, it is important to know the shift. It is more important to know the mechanism that makes the fact true, because the mechanism doesn&amp;#39;t change but the fact does. &lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Again, disclaimer in that I&amp;#39;m just some guy. &lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;ll try to contextualize this a little better, even though I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t because I have work to do. In history there is a lively debate about what, exactly &amp;#39;history&amp;#39; is. Is it the history of states of affairs, of events, etc or is it the study of people? This is a huge point of contention within the discipline. Foucault would history as a study of people makes sense, but history as a study of events and the more &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; things is patently absurd because the people reporting those things have these influences of power on them, colouring the way it is perceived and reported. So you can study the people reporting the events, but you can&amp;#39;t really study the events themselves. Of course this is a simplification and dilution but I believe it to be the jist of the controversy. &lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/div&gt;","stickied":false,"subreddit_type":"public","can_gild":true,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"\\/r\\/AskHistorians\\/comments\\/a2dkmw\\/the_physician_in_the_autopsy_of_charles_ii_gave\\/eaykl1c\\/","num_reports":null,"name":"t1_eaykl1c","created":1543819610,"subreddit":"AskHistorians","author_flair_text":null,"collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\\/AskHistorians","ups":134,"depth":2,"author_flair_background_color":null,"mod_reports":[],"mod_note":null,"distinguished":null}}],"after":null,"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"eay1vmz","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"QuelqueChoseRose","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1543780280,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_eaxws3p","score":96,"author_fullname":"t2_d2a7u","approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"Why is Foucault so controversial?","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is Foucault so controversial?&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/div&gt;","stickied":false,"subreddit_type":"public","can_gild":true,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"author_flair_text_color":null,"score_hidden":false,"permalink":"\\/r\\/AskHistorians\\/comments\\/a2dkmw\\/the_physician_in_the_autopsy_of_charles_ii_gave\\/eay1vmz\\/","num_reports":null,"name":"t1_eay1vmz","created":1543809080,"subreddit":"AskHistorians","author_flair_text":null,"collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\\/AskHistorians","ups":96,"depth":1,"author_flair_background_color":null,"mod_reports":[],"mod_note":null,"distinguished":null}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","approved_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","removal_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_a2dkmw","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"no_follow":false,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","dist":null,"children":[{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","approved_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","removal_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_a2dkmw","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"no_follow":false,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","dist":null,"children":[{"kind":"more","data":{"count":1,"name":"t1_ebgcxf4","id":"ebgcxf4","parent_id":"t1_eaya5ty","depth":3,"children":["ebgcxf4"]}}],"after":null,"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"eaya5ty","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"BedsideRounds","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1543784707,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_eaxzxc1","score":63,"author_fullname":"t2_kpcsn","approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"I am at best a hobbyist in paleopathology :)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo I\'m an academic internal medicine physician, and I specialized in global health (did an MPH in international health and development, worked in Botswana, did an internal medicine fellowship, and dabbled in research in sepsis in LMIC).\\n\\n  \\nI have no formal training in my \\"specialty,\\" which is basically a podcasting hobby taken too far and luck to find good mentors.

'body' => 'Gosh, what a great question! It\'s such a great question, in fact, that **there is no definitive answer to it.** (Maybe you can be the person who [trawls the Nixon tapes](http://nixontapes.org/) and finds the answer.)

Before I start the discussion, it might be worth pointing out something that you (well, maybe not *you* in particular /u/TrynnaFindaBalance, but *you* collectively, as in everyone reading this) might have overlooked.

What\'s obvious to us today, with the benefit of hindsight, was not clear to Nixon or anyone else in the United States in early 1972. We know the results, and so we have an artificial assurance that because things turned out they way they did, they *must* have turned out that way. Living in the moment is to live in uncertainty.

At the start of 1972, opinion polls showed Nixon and the various Democratic contenders in a close contest. [Sen. Edmund Muskie was considered a strong candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/31/archives/nixon-and-muskie-nearly-even-at-43-and-42-in-gallup-poll.html), and Nixon feared facing Alabama Gov. George Wallace (who was ultimately incapacitated in a May 1972 assassination attempt). 

At the start of the year, when G. Gordon Liddy and Attorney General John Mitchell discussed the campaign to harass and sabotage the Democratic Party, Nixon\'s wide victory wasn\'t yet apparent. That would come later.

It\'s also important to remember that the June break-in — for which Gonzales, Barker, McCord, Martinez, and Sturgis became infamous — was only part of the campaign approved by Nixon\'s backers (including Liddy). That campaign also included wiretapping and other kinds of snooping. **Remember that Nixon himself may not have been aware of the exact activities: It was the coverup that got him in trouble.**

But that doesn\'t get to your key question: "What were the burglars after?"

There are *a ton* of fun theories about this. The most popular theory is that Nixon believed that Democratic National Committee chairman Lawrence O\'Brien had some dirt on a loan given by billionaire Howard Hughes (yes, of Spruce Goose and "The Aviator" fame) to Nixon in 1969. Some of that money, [according to reporting by "60 Minutes,"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watergate-aviator-connection/) went to paying for frills at Nixon\'s Key Biscayne home.

[E. Howard Hunt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ex-spy-crafted-watergate-other-schemes/2012/05/31/gJQAh80uFV_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d90adae4247e), who hired the burglars, told the *Miami Herald* in 1997 that they were actually looking for ties between the Democratic National Committee and foreign governments. They were searching for evidence of foreign campaign contributions (something that might be familiar to Americans lately), which would make great dirt in the election that year.

“What we were looking for is the same thing every congressional committee is looking for today, which was evidence of illegal foreign contributions,” he told *Herald*. “That was the rationale for going in there. We’d heard rumors that both the Vietnamese and Fidel Castro were inserting funds illegally into the Democratic National Committee. And the idea was to look at the books, photograph them, in and out, and that’s it. It didn’t seem like such a deal to me. You know, I’d been doing that stuff for years, a ‘black-bag job’ into other embassies. But you know, I didn’t have skilled people.”

In 2001, [Liddy testified that the burglars weren\'t after anything political](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/30/us/g-gordon-liddy-gives-first-testimony-on-watergate-break-in.html): They were actually looking for photographs that put the wife of White House counsel John Dean into a call-girl ring. 

Contemporaneous rumors held that the motive behind the burglary was to find evidence held by the Democrats that linked Nixon to various assassination attempts made by the United States against Fidel Castro. A lot of those rumors stemmed from the fact that the Watergate burglars had deep ties to anti-Castro plotters, and some Americans reveled in the idea that the nation\'s dirty tricks had come home to roost.

[Columnist George Will has an interesting theory](https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/08/reason-watergate-george-will/) that ties the motive to events happening in the days surrounding the burglary. One year before the break-in, the *New York Times* began publishing the Pentagon Papers. Will has suggested that Nixon was worried that the Papers would expose Nixon\'s 1968 role in sabotaging peace talks related to the Vietnam War. Nixon\'s successful sabotage of those talks, revealed only in the past few years, violated the Logan Act of 1799. 

Regardless of the motive, it seems likely that Nixon himself had no particular knowledge of the June break-in, but he did know broadly about a campaign of "dirty tricks" against the Democratic Party to hamper Democrats\' efforts to fight him in 1972. And as I said before, it wasn\'t the break-in that ultimately forced Nixon to resign: It was the cover-up. 

That\'s something worth remembering.',

If I were to investigate the very good question of OP, that is where I would head, but these are more literary interpretations of the man and Watergate than the stuff of history.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/div&gt;","stickied":false,"subreddit_type":"public","can_gild":true,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"\\/r\\/AskHistorians\\/comments\\/8dyr78\\/nixon_won_reelection_in_1972_with_the_widest\\/dxrvvmg\\/","num_reports":null,"name":"t1_dxrvvmg","created":1524424555,"subreddit":"AskHistorians","author_flair_text":"American West | European Folklore","collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\\/AskHistorians","ups":257,"depth":1,"author_flair_background_color":"","mod_reports":[],"mod_note":null,"distinguished":null}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2ssp3","approved_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_by":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","removal_reason":null,"link_id":"t3_8dyr78","author_flair_template_id":null,"likes":null,"no_follow":false,"replies":{"kind":"Listing","data":{"modhash":"","dist":null,"children":[{"kind":"more","data":{"count":4,"name":"t1_dxsmq8g","id":"dxsmq8g","parent_id":"t1_dxrxftl","depth":2,"children":["dxsmq8g","dxs7bdm","dxs8llw","dxs69hy"]}}],"after":null,"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"dxrxftl","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"a_kam","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1524399144,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_dxrtiue","score":21,"author_fullname":"t2_aymfn","approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"Great answer!

It probably helps to split the question up: Why would the Nixon team do *something like that* and why would they do *exactly that*? 

------------

The first question isn\'t that difficult to answer when you look at the operations that immediately before that. There was the break-in into the office of Daniel Ellsbergs psychiatrist, the attempt to dig up (more) dirt on the
Chappaquidick incident, the forged Diem cables to further damage the Kennedy government and more *dirty tricks*. 

That was driven by two factors: a) the belief that the democrats were playing as dirty as they were and that such tricks had cost Nixon the presidency in 1960 and b) the general conviction that *looks* mattered more *issues* when it came to politics. There are many examples for both points on the Watergate tapes. Nixon was convinced that the Democrats had bugged his campaign in 1960 and employed Ex-FBI agents to sweep his hotel rooms and offices when he ran in 1968. And there are many quotes by Bob Haldemann, Nixons Chief of Staff and Ex-advertisment executive that show how focused the White House was with      the public opinion:

*We failed to move on to the PR stage. We should have been able to make the PR case, at least, even though we couldn’t carry the legal case. [...] We need a strong offense. The question is – can we sell it [...]. Our whole concern now  must be the public aspects of this. The morality issue is moot because the papers are already out.*

(Haldemann Action Paper: The New York Times Papers. June 15, 1971, in: Bruce Oudes: From the President. Richard Nixon\'s secret files. New York 1990, 271.)

The explanation that the Watergate break-in was in character for the Nixon administration is probably not very *sexy* argument, but it is the approach to understand it. Nixon and his closest advisers fostered a siege mentality in the White House and sincerely believed that it was *them* vs the *corrupt Eastern establishment.* This deep mistrust to the established institutions led directly to the absurd secrecy and clandestine projects that brought his administration down.

-----------------

Now, why did they target the Watergate and the DNC? That\'s way more difficult to answer. There are tons of stupid conspiracy theories about this. One says that the wife of Nixon advisor John Dean had been working as an escort. Larry O\'Brian, the DNC chairman had evidence of that in his files, so John Dean ordered the break-in to get these photos. There\'s no good evidence for that and all those other theories that say the Nixon team was searching for some specific informations in O\'Brian\'s files: Evidence of bribes to Nixon from Howard Hughes, explosive information concerning the Kennedy assassination, ...

Here, again, the best explanation is rather boring: Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy went (kinda) rogue and organized the break-in on their own. It\'s like the assassination of Thomas Becket: *Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?*

Hunt and Liddy were hired because the White House was very dissatisfied by the recent work of the FBI. Hoover was old and ailing, and the FBI saw itself as a weapon against communist agents and traitors; most of its agents didn\'t care or understood the political infighting in Washington.

Nixon repeatedly railed against disloyal government employees and officials that had been appointed by the JFK and LBJ administrations. The antiwar movement was undermining the government, the media was completely controlled by these forces, and the FBI was just worried about foreign agents directly controlled by Moscow. Gordon Liddy wrote several memos that directly attack the wrong focus of Hoover and the FBI:

*Today it is the Ellsbergs in sensitive positions in Government we must contend with. The past 15-20 years have witnessed the evolution of a new breed of fanatics.*

(Memorandum Re: Organizational Survey, July 23, 1971, in: WHSF-SMOF: David Young, Box 13, Folder: Office Chron File of G. Gordon Libby, RNPL)

The Nixon administration had tried to integrate the FBI in the White House (the infamous *Huston Plan*) but Hoover had prevented that and kept the Bureau independent. So Nixon\'s advisers created their own team for *domestic intelligence operations*, the *Plumbers*. One of their founding members, Egil Krogh, wrote later:

*Liddy’s report to us about [the] deficiency [of the FBI] was an important factor in the self-help mentality that then began to emerge in the unit. Rather than questioning the Bureau’s lack of support, we resolved to go forward on our own with this investigation.*

(Egil Krogh: Integrity. Good People, Bad Choices, and Life Lessons from the White House. New York 2007.)

This *self-help mentality* is important to understand the actions of the Plumbers. 

I think it\'s save to say that Nixon didn\'t know about the break-in and hadn\'t ordered it. Hunt and Liddy hadn\'t thought the operation through, there was no direct goal and specific plan to follow. It was born out of the general belief that *something* had to be done. That the upcoming election was looking bright wasn\'t the point: Nixon and his advisers worked under the perception that the general public, the political establishment and the officials in Washington were against them. You can\'t govern efficiently under these conditions, which the next election won\'t change. So you gotta help yourself.

Nixon didn\'t knew about the Ellsberg break-in beforehand, but approved it afterwards. The general goal was to find evidence that would damage Ellsbergs reputation in the public. But the Plumbers found nothing, because psychiatrist usually don\'t keep their notes in these office files. The whole burglary was poorly planed, so-so executed, and yieled absolutly nothing of value at all. It was done by the same personal that a couple of weeks later got caught inside the Watergate, so it\'s probably save to draw a few conclusions from that.

Several people (Haldemann, Ehrlichman, Coulson) wrote in their memoirs that they pretty quickly recognized Watergate as the foolish third rate burglary that it was. I think that\'s written with the benefit of hindsight. Would they\'ve come to the same conclusion if Liddy and Hunt didn\'t get caught? I don\'t think so. Watergate was too much in character for the Nixon administration. Limited upside, a lack of clear goal and not fully thought through plans hadn\'t stopped their other operations either.

Even by the time that the statue had arrived in the US, it had shifted from the red-brown copper it had shown off in Paris to a pure brown as the patination had begun (Thanks to /u/ducatimechanic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8w6pie/the_statue_of_liberty_is_now_green_but_it_used_to/e1u0s6v/), this is a [guide](https://i.imgur.com/35o8587.gif) to visualize the change). It was fully expected that patination would occur, and for that matter, *important* that it would. Although Bartholdi apparently had hoped it would end up in a bronzed color, the statue staying its natural copper would be awful for it, structurally, and in restoration work that has happened, it has been important not to disturb the patina, because it is a layer of protection against the elements, which helps prevent further corrosion. Removing it, or worse, maintaining a continual cleaning schedule to prevent it at all, would just mean the copper would just continue to deteriorate away! This was of great concern in the \'80s when a massive restoration effort was underway, especially when a cleaner being used on the interior seeped out and started to dissolve the patina in places, which workers had to quickly work to stop. 

Checking through what literature I can find, the real issue concerning restoration has always been focused around who pays for it. The Statue of Liberty proved to be a somewhat awkward gift that left the US Government in a quandary, unsure quite what to do with it, and as such it fell into an administrative quagmire of competing jurisdictions. The National Lighthouse Board, the US Army, and the American Committee (the group which had fund-raised for the pedestal and operated ferries to visit), for various reasons, all had some level of responsibility, but also all insisted that the other groups were the ones who should be maintaining it. A 1890 bill was defeated in Congress that would have made is a public park maintained by the Federal government, and it wasn\'t until another decade had passed that Congress agreed to a small one time expenditure of $62,800, which was enough to do some interior painting and install the elevator, but hardly enough to anything more substantial, or long-lasting. 

Now, to be sure, there was a good deal of public concern about this, and a number of newspapers, starting within a few years of the statue\'s arrival, decried this, but it doesn\'t seem to be about the color. As already noted, the patina plays an important role in preservation, and the only articles I could find from the time which makes reference to any calls to strip the patina are focused on explaining why it would be a bad idea! There were *some* people saying it should happen, but one author, writing in 1910, makes it fairly clear it was a proposal that was ignored:

&gt;The patina is the rust on bronze, which, however, does not, like the rust on iron, corrode the metal. It is green in color, the exact shade depending on the amount of alloy used with the copper to form the bronze. It is formed by the statue gathering from the atmosphere carbon and sulpher, and in the formation of nitrate copper crystals on the surface.

&gt;"In the case of the Statue of Liberty on Bedloe\'s Island" said Mr. [Gutzon] Borglum, "the continuous washing of the wain and the spray keeps it clean. I should have gone to Washington, if necessary, if the proposal to take away its patina had been likely to be adopted a year or so ago. People said then that it was eating into the metal, and that in certain placed the bronze was rent away. All I can say is, if there are any thin places they are the result of flaws in the original casting."

So again, as this suggests, there was clearly *some people* calling for the patina to be stripped, but from the start, experts were making clear that it was not needed, and a bad idea. An earlier article, from 1903, is even further in praise of the green, noting that of burgeoning hue at that point:

&gt;Kindly nature has been spinning for her a fine cobwebby outer raiment or verdanlique, deeper in one place, lighter in another. Snows and stinging hail, fogs and rainstorms have been gently removing the repulsive newness of her bronze and streaking cheek and uplifted arm, draperies and crown with tender shades or green such as the cleverest bronze rounders try to produce with chemicals on their new \'castings, but never quite succeed in simulating.

The author further warns against any voices which might "*shriek wildly for scrubbing brush and Putz-powder"*, not just for the writer\'s aesthetic tastes, but also again for the protective covering the patina offers. The editorial also calls for the appointment of a \'keeper of public monuments\', specifically to ensure ignorance doesn\'t result in the destruction of monuments, not just \'Lady Liberty\', a position which seems to have at least somewhat come about by 1910, as that seems to be the role Gutzon Borglum was assisting in by then. Additionally, as before, this suggests the existence of those who desired a de-greening, but again that despite their existence, it was a call which experts pushed back against.

One related thing I did find, which I would also make mention of, was a call not for a stripping down to the natural copper color, but instead to paint it! An article in 1906 makes mention of such a proposal, and again the author instead favors the "marvelous harmony of blended colors" from the "varying shades of light green, delicate white, and a subtle dash of yellow" which by that point have almost entirely overtaken the bronzed hues. The proposal had been written up in several papers, but at least as presented in this article, but was clearly not in an advanced stage of planning. Capt. George Burnell, in command on the island for the War Department, mentioned to the author the "bushels of letters", almost all of which were aghast at the proposal - which additionally helps to point to the acceptance of the green quite quickly - and additionally talks to copper experts who find the idea not only unnecessary, but quite ludicrous. Unfortunately I was unable to find the original announcement, but it is certainly clear enough that it all came to naught.

Anyways though, to continue with this more general over view of restoration, during the Wilson Administration, a Public-Private partnership with the *World* newspaper saw another $30,000 from the government, but again, it was a one time expenditure, and this time for installing flood-lights. Lights which, lacking maintenance funds, had mostly ceased working by 1930.

This funding morass continued through the 1930s, when it finally was moved to the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, as part of a larger push under the FDR administration, in step with the New Deal, to give \'Lady Liberty\' her due as a symbol of the country. Unable to get the funds solely on its own, between 1937 and 1941 the NPS worked in conjunction with the PWA and WPA to give the statue its first real overhaul, a $1.5 million dollar makeover which involved clearing the entire island of buildings to start fresh, building a seawall, a new dock, walkways, and most importantly much needed maintenance of the internal iron structure - although not quite extensive enough - which was becoming quite rusted at points, thanks to the salty seawater surrounding it. Much was done, but of course the outbreak of war in late 1941 brought it to a halt. Work would resume again in 1946 to wrap up work unfinished in \'41, but over the next decade or so, the real focus with funding was on the creation of an American Museum of Immigration, which would eventually open in 1972 after a long and fraught \'battle\'.

By 1981, even the work done by the NPS decades earlier was showing its age, and spurred by an analysis by French architects, a renewed focus on a *thorough* overhaul of the statue, especially in light of the upcoming centennial, began to be planned, perhaps most famously with American Express donating a penny for every purchase made with their card to the endeavor, resulting in $1.7 million dollars. Closed to the public in 1984 for the work - and as noted above, careful not to disturb the green! - the work was completed in time for the "Liberty Weekend" centennial celebration in 1986, with President Reagan turning on the floodlights the night of July 3rd, and the statue officially reopened on the 5th.

'body_html' => '&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best that I can find, there wasn&amp;#39;t much call for this. A &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt;, which I&amp;#39;ll touch on, but it seems to have been quite muted. Even by the time that the statue had arrived in the US, it had shifted from the red-brown copper it had shown off in Paris to a pure brown as the patination had begun (Thanks to &lt;a href="/u/ducatimechanic"&gt;/u/ducatimechanic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8w6pie/the_statue_of_liberty_is_now_green_but_it_used_to/e1u0s6v/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, this is a &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/35o8587.gif"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; to visualize the change). It was fully expected that patination would occur, and for that matter, &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; that it would. Although Bartholdi apparently had hoped it would end up in a bronzed color, the statue staying its natural copper would be awful for it, structurally, and in restoration work that has happened, it has been important not to disturb the patina, because it is a layer of protection against the elements, which helps prevent further corrosion. Removing it, or worse, maintaining a continual cleaning schedule to prevent it at all, would just mean the copper would just continue to deteriorate away! This was of great concern in the &amp;#39;80s when a massive restoration effort was underway, especially when a cleaner being used on the interior seeped out and started to dissolve the patina in places, which workers had to quickly work to stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking through what literature I can find, the real issue concerning restoration has always been focused around who pays for it. The Statue of Liberty proved to be a somewhat awkward gift that left the US Government in a quandary, unsure quite what to do with it, and as such it fell into an administrative quagmire of competing jurisdictions. The National Lighthouse Board, the US Army, and the American Committee (the group which had fund-raised for the pedestal and operated ferries to visit), for various reasons, all had some level of responsibility, but also all insisted that the other groups were the ones who should be maintaining it. A 1890 bill was defeated in Congress that would have made is a public park maintained by the Federal government, and it wasn&amp;#39;t until another decade had passed that Congress agreed to a small one time expenditure of $62,800, which was enough to do some interior painting and install the elevator, but hardly enough to anything more substantial, or long-lasting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to be sure, there was a good deal of public concern about this, and a number of newspapers, starting within a few years of the statue&amp;#39;s arrival, decried this, but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be about the color.

'body' => 'Children\'s culture in history can be difficult to study. Adult observers tend to reflect more formal types of play and practice; memoirs reflect the haze of memory and *desired* memory; it\'s sometimes difficult to tell whether schoolbook exercises represent an individual experience or a standard trope. In this case, fortunately, a look at the broader culture of children\'s wargaming in early modern Europe can help answer the question.

Children\'s play often imitates the adult world for two reasons: first, children mirror what they see; second, adults encourage it to help prepare children for the future. The encouragement of martial play among boys (only boys) in the late Middle Ages and early modern era is a good illustration of these. We have stories from hagiography of the future saint who stepped aside from the mock swordfighting to play at being a priest dispensing the Eucharist, and proverbs observing that when children play at swords, war is in the air. From the adult encouragement angle, with the rise of a visible toymaking industry from the fourteenth century, hobby-horses and swords were among the most popular items.

Although toy guns start to appear from the later half of the sixteenth century, it\'s really in the seventeenth that guns displace the swords of knighthood as boys\' wargame toy of choice. This is in conjunction with the encouraged realism of militaristic play. Memoirs of noblemen raised at a royal court, like Louis Henri with Louis XIV, stress the popularity of fully organized "armies" of boys marching and drilling under their "commander," the king. And this was in no way limited to the elite of the elite. Army-style drills were not just a major component of the all-around education of boys at grammar and secondary school--school sponsorship of these types of exercise actually served as a *marketing appeal*. The Lincoln Grammar School stressed the realism of its schoolyard play in opposition to "childish games": *its* students "exercised in all their military postures, and in assaults and
defenses."  And from the 17th century, assaults and defenses meant guns.

With princes and high nobles, it seems that the guns and cannons would be smaller, boy-sized versions, but real. Louis Henri describes learning how to shoot with a harquebus that then-Prince Louis gave him, and mentions how he and the other boys (which is to say, their fathers) lavished the future king with many and diverse shooting weapons.

But moving down the social ladder to the urban middle classes (presumably), actual toy guns were *exceedingly* popular among boys. Actual records are scanty, of course, but archaeological digs and trawls of the Thames (where worn out or unneeded toys might be disposed of, or make their way there through a sewer or settlement) turn up toy guns and cannons as among the most numerous survivals. And for the most part, these toys appear to have been designed for mock shooting, including packing with powder and pellets to fire.

But children playing with toy guns in the manner they were designed to be used by adults is not yet the same as children making the leap themselves. For *that*, we turn to disciplinary and legal records of situations where boys improvised. One student of the Bodwin School participated in wargaming exercises not just by carrying a dummy gun. He actually got a candle, hollowed it out, and packed it with powder. This isn\'t a mock stick, but it\'s pretty close.

There are plenty of tragic events where children did not realize a gun was loaded, went to play with it, and killed a playmate or bystander by accident. But one case from turn of the 18th century London demonstrates the realism that permeates surviving accounts of boys\' wargaming. A twelve-year-old apprentice came across his master\'s gun and wanted to play with it. But he wasn\'t content to point and cock and click, like plenty of boys did in the cases where the gun proved to be loaded. No, for this boy, playing with guns started with inserting the stick and packing it with powder.

Some caution is of course warranted. These aren\'t cases of boys pointing sticks at each other and making exploding noises with their mouths. And surviving sources, as I\'ve discussed, are going to be biased towards more realistic types of games. Nevertheless, the combination of being so steeped in militaristic "play" and the general tendency to learn adulting by observation led our two improvisers to want "toy guns" that mirrored the real thing at every step except the very last. It seems likely, therefore, that just like we can all remember a range of ways we "played pretend" with "guns" when we were little, 17th and 18th century boys also scaled up towards imitating the real thing with whatever they had.

There are some earlier engineering texts from the Islamic world that attack new and improved ways to make existing technology\\/make it better at what it does. And even the designs in the libri mechanorum of the 15th-16th centuries feature creative permutations of existing technology into bigger machines (there are some really interesting examples for firefighting, for example) rather than something parallel to the modern concept of \\"futuristic.\\"\\n\\nOn the other hand, if you\'ll permit a jump across the Atlantic, I think there is evidence that early modern (and early, modern) children in their own imagined worlds would have been on the futuristic\\/alternative scale of imagination creation just like today. First, we have a lot of evidence for the practice of either improvising toys or straight-up creating them in colonial America. Boys in particular would carve mock guns out of wood. There\'s even actual evidence for what shouldn\'t come as a surprise to anyone who remembers being a kid: the ability to transform a mundane object into an elaborate reality. One New Jerseyite recounted watching his friend\'s little daughter tie strings to the back of a chair and then walk back and forth and wrap them, which in her mind was a spinning wheel.\\n\\nSecond, you\'ll recall that the examples I discussed in the OP involve mirroring or recreating adult culture, with an eye towards becoming an adult one day or admiring them in the present. With toy laserguns, on the other hand, we\'ve moved into the idea of something that represents a different culture. Howard Chudacoff, *Children at Play: An American History,* describes white colonial boys demonstrating the kernel of this type of practice. They would play with bow and arrows or mock arrows in imitation of their ideas about Native Americans.\\n\\nThird and combining those two points: the long, gradual incubation of science fiction as a literary genre across the 19th century coincides with the rise of children\'s literature (as entertainment). One of the foremost figures in this movement was the recurring character Frank Reade, Jr.--the teenage inventor. He had engineering-based adventures all over the U.S., in books by multiple authors, that hinged on his invention of wild new technologies. (Steampunk before punk, if you will). True, these were written by adults. But their overwhelming popularity among younger readers suggests the dazzling appeal of \\"futuristic technology\\" as entertainment. And while I\'m not familiar with firsthand accounts of \\"playing Frank Reade,\\" the idea of replicating literature in play has a rich presence in 19th century literature (including books popular with younger readers, if not necessarily children). I\'m pretty sure I first learned about *Pilgrim\'s Progress* by reading how the March sisters would \\"play\\" it!\\n\\nGiven what we know about the propensity towards improvisation and the fun that could be had imitating cultures besides one\'s own impending adulthood, it seems reasonable that children\'s imaginary worlds sometimes did expand to encompass the idea of a technologically-different future that becomes so crucial to a rising genre of literature.","edited":1506676071,"author_flair_css_class":"europe","is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oxford &lt;a href=\\"http:\\/\\/www.jessesword.com\\/sf\\/list\\/?page=6\\"&gt;Science Fiction Citations Project&lt;\\/a&gt; aims to track down the earliest use of terms in a &amp;quot;science fiction sense&amp;quot; (for example, &lt;em&gt;credit&lt;\\/em&gt; was in common use to mean &amp;quot;buy now, pay later&amp;quot; before it was adopted by SF writers as the generic Currency of the Future; this group is concerned with the latter).

And even the designs in the libri mechanorum of the 15th-16th centuries feature creative permutations of existing technology into bigger machines (there are some really interesting examples for firefighting, for example) rather than something parallel to the modern concept of &amp;quot;futuristic.&amp;quot;&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you&amp;#39;ll permit a jump across the Atlantic, I think there is evidence that early modern (and early, modern) children in their own imagined worlds would have been on the futuristic\\/alternative scale of imagination creation just like today. First, we have a lot of evidence for the practice of either improvising toys or straight-up creating them in colonial America. Boys in particular would carve mock guns out of wood. There&amp;#39;s even actual evidence for what shouldn&amp;#39;t come as a surprise to anyone who remembers being a kid: the ability to transform a mundane object into an elaborate reality. One New Jerseyite recounted watching his friend&amp;#39;s little daughter tie strings to the back of a chair and then walk back and forth and wrap them, which in her mind was a spinning wheel.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Second, you&amp;#39;ll recall that the examples I discussed in the OP involve mirroring or recreating adult culture, with an eye towards becoming an adult one day or admiring them in the present. With toy laserguns, on the other hand, we&amp;#39;ve moved into the idea of something that represents a different culture. Howard Chudacoff, &lt;em&gt;Children at Play: An American History,&lt;\\/em&gt; describes white colonial boys demonstrating the kernel of this type of practice. They would play with bow and arrows or mock arrows in imitation of their ideas about Native Americans.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Third and combining those two points: the long, gradual incubation of science fiction as a literary genre across the 19th century coincides with the rise of children&amp;#39;s literature (as entertainment). One of the foremost figures in this movement was the recurring character Frank Reade, Jr.--the teenage inventor. He had engineering-based adventures all over the U.S., in books by multiple authors, that hinged on his invention of wild new technologies. (Steampunk before punk, if you will). True, these were written by adults. But their overwhelming popularity among younger readers suggests the dazzling appeal of &amp;quot;futuristic technology&amp;quot; as entertainment. And while I&amp;#39;m not familiar with firsthand accounts of &amp;quot;playing Frank Reade,&amp;quot; the idea of replicating literature in play has a rich presence in 19th century literature (including books popular with younger readers, if not necessarily children). I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I first learned about &lt;em&gt;Pilgrim&amp;#39;s Progress&lt;\\/em&gt; by reading how the March sisters would &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; it!&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Given what we know about the propensity towards improvisation and the fun that could be had imitating cultures besides one&amp;#39;s own impending adulthood, it seems reasonable that children&amp;#39;s imaginary worlds sometimes did expand to encompass the idea of a technologically-different future that becomes so crucial to a rising genre of literature.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/div&gt;","stickied":false,"subreddit_type":"public","can_gild":true,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"\\/r\\/AskHistorians\\/comments\\/733gy5\\/kids_these_days_like_to_pretend_sticks_are_guns\\/dnnzfdx\\/","num_reports":null,"name":"t1_dnnzfdx","created":1506703608,"subreddit":"AskHistorians","author_flair_text":"Moderator | Medieval &amp; Earliest Modern Europe","collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\\/AskHistorians","ups":161,"depth":2,"author_flair_background_color":"","mod_reports":[],"mod_note":null,"distinguished":null}}],"after":null,"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"dnntu8h","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Pandemic21","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1506661382,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_dnnjm68","score":43,"author_fullname":"t2_9pawx","approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"I used to pretend to shoot a laser gun.

Since this question asks about "Native American" restaurants specifically, I\'ll focus on a couple of moments in restaurant history where food perspectives of various Native peoples were cut out of wider American fine and family dining. However, an integral part of the story is indeed the targeted destruction of Native food cultures by white Americans - especially since, archaeologists and oral tradition tell us, adoption and modification of foodways rather than wholesale switchover had been the result of intertribal contact before 1500. 

The corn/squash/beans agriculture of the Southwest nations had spread east and then north up the Mississippi and tributaries. But the Algonquians and Iroquois, like other Eastern Woodlands nations, would spend the winter in their permanent towns and villages through the spring planting season, then move to waterlines (rivers, lakes, ocean) for a few months. They would catch and preserve fish for the present and for the rest of the year, and return home when the crops needed taking care of and harvest. The foraging and hunting seems to have been traditional to the Eastern Woodlands people before the addition of agriculture--the Algonquians only added farming in the 16th century, it seems, later than the Iroquois. The introduction of new technology and even new foods, in other words, did not have to destroy foodways. Unfortunately, that would become a major reason for the scarcity of Native American or specific Native nations\' restaurant cuisine today.

The first stage in American restaurant history I want to look at is the mid-19th century. The rise of "dining establishments" had happened quickly from the age of the smalltime colonial tavern - a skyrocketing American economy drew international businessmen to glittering urban hotels, whose dining rooms became well-known and catered to an audienced used to, above all, French and English food. It was the needs of business that, in America, detached food service places from sleeping, as workers in the earlier 19th century needed lunch on the job.

Why this mattered was the creation of highly "ethnic" communities in cities and rural/township regions through immigration, settlement, and employment patterns. From the 1840s, as midday food service places proliferated and eventually broadened their service, immigrant groups built their own ethnic food places to serve their own communities - the innumerable *Biergarten* of St. Louis, Missouri, for example. (Budweiser beer was born out of one such - failing! - establishment after the Civil War). For the most part, ethnic restaurants continued to target only their linguistic/cultural community. But it\'s significant for our overall story because it marks the foundational establishment of ethnic cuisine at a time that explicitly excluded Native nations.

Because, for those of you keeping score at home, that era that America was beginning to host ethnic restaurants was the same period that white America doubled down on its endless campaign of cultural genocide against Indians.

The deportation and exile of Indigenous people to typically isolated reservations - the areas white people didn\'t want to live! - by logic removed them from the opportunity to plant restaurants in bustling towns and thriving cities. But more importantly, the forced moves inherently ruined existing foodways in a lot of cases (you can\'t fish for salmon in the richest waters if you don\'t have access to the richest waters) and white American policies took care of the rest. The kidnapping of Native children and compulsory acquisition of Anglo-American cookery skills at boarding schools and mission schools went a long way towards wiping out traditional patterns.

In some cases, Indian cultures had the ability to adapt traditional foodways to new technology and ideas the same way white Americans were adopting their traditional cuisine. The Objibwa method of drying blueberries was superseded by canning technology and processed sugars, but they nevertheless continued (and continue today) to keep berries as a major part of their diet. (On the other hand, pressure from outside meant the berries were increasingly used in very European pies and European-style puddings, not ones thickened by corn as had been prepared for centuries.) In other cases, though, traditional knowledge was lost - actively destroyed - altogether.

Back on the restaurant scene: American xenophobia and (ironically) nativism in the early 19th century kept the ethnic restaurants and ethnic food - above all the "spicy" dishes of Italians and Chinese and other not-white-enough immigrants - somewhat sequestered in their own communities. However, one should note that the increasingly shrill anti-flavor voices were probably reacting to an increased broader public acceptance of said edible food. Some of the early cracks in the shell came through the World\'s Fairs of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where Americans could dine on the "cuisine of foreign countries". Of course, this meant largely foreign *white* countries. The World\'s Fairs were rather better known for showing off the technological and cultural achievements of one set of countries and peoples, and showing off *individual, living human beings* of another set of countries and peoples as curiosities in and of themselves. So again, Native Americans - and here we should note also the scarcity of sub-Saharan nations\' ethnic restaurants in the U.S. - were left out of the broadening of the white American palate.

The explosion in cookbooks and preserved foodstuffs in the early/mid-nineteenth century was actually a time Native women, in particular, tried to capture and assert the strength of their cultural foodways. In 1933, the Indian Women\'s Club of Tulsa, Oklahoma produced the first Native cookbook. You can read [one recipe](https://books.google.com/books?id=JTBSpuCkl9AC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=%22indian+cook+book%22+oklahoma+1933&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R7lh_cIgFv&amp;sig=ycw8WBSieKkEqT5MW-YQb7UdOoo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiszbyC36rXAhWH1IMKHQvyBXMQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22indian%20cook%20book%22%20oklahoma%201933&amp;f=false), from Creek Indian and club president Lilah Lindsay, on Google Books! Amanda Amanda\'s *Choctaw Indian Dishes* in 1935 seems to have been the first professional cookbook promoting one tribe\'s foodways.

Native women\'s efforts in the cookbook scene went further towards *preserving* various cultures\' foodways for themselves and for each other, than promoting it to a broader American public with more money and more desire to "eat out" for entertainment and family socializing. The 1940s seem to have been the era when "dining *ethnic*" took off as a popular social act. Especially in major cities, immigrants began to establish restaurants outside their country-of-origin neighborhood. 

However, once again, the foodways that became popular with white people were most often associated with Europe - in particular France, at this time, actually. (AskHistorians has some experts on Asian-American food cultures who will know more about that particular evolution). And once again, Native Americans were systematically excluded from this development, with the endurance of the reservation system and the difficulties or impossibilities of living an explicitly and marked Native life *as a community* outside. 

Native nations were also excluded from the rise of "American regional" dining, which is generally considered to have been born with the Four Seasons in 1959. "Regional" did not include the Native map of America.

Every history of Native foodways will end with a spot of hope for the future. The tradition of cookbooks established by Lilah Lindsay and the Indian Women\'s Club of Tulsa, to which we probably owe a sizeable debt for preservation of traditional recipes through the mid/late-20th century rise of TV dinners and standardized fast food fare, flourishes; maybe you *have* had the chance to be a guest at a powwow or attend a restaurant featuring traditional local Native foods as opposed to simply appropriating the name.

I hope that a lot of you really interested in the question of why most of us *don\'t* have much exposure to Native American foods today will head over to /r/IndianCountry and read or ask a little about how to *get* that exposure. :)

'body' => 'I previously worked on cultural resources (gathering historic research, identifying culturally-sensitive plants and natural resources, and communicating with local tribal representatives) for military installations in the Pacific Northwest. Just moved to the Southeast where I helped with an intertribal powwow, but I\'m still learning about the local history and tribes here. When I use the word "American" or "Native/Native American" I refer to North American or North American Indigenous, respectively, though again my expertise is more from the PNW. 

Much of what is currently, regularly eaten by many Native Americans is not the same as what their ancestors traditionally ate and prepared. Communities on some reservations sometimes face the same sort of food deserts that many non-Native American neighborhoods suffer from--cheap junk food and limited fresh produce. Access to traditional ingredients or food knowledge can be very limited. For example, on a lot of the Army training grounds in WA, the military is supposed to immediately cease training to allow (some, depending) tribes to forage for native plants needed for traditional food preparations and ceremonies, though I\'ve personally never met anyone who said they recall them actually exercising that right. These plants don\'t exactly grow on the most accessible terrain. And when I was gathering information on native plants for signage, I discovered that much of it had traditionally been eaten--but were often regarded as famine foods, or had challenging preparations (such as [Chinook acorns, which required curing in urine](https://books.google.com/books?id=IQdpCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT80&amp;lpg=PT80&amp;dq=chinook+olives&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FkXAZj039c&amp;sig=GLx_W6oReHa1VQaNwZqxonHbUUA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR1KGYxKrXAhVH8WMKHVAYDf0Q6AEIYjAO#v=onepage&amp;q=chinook%20olives&amp;f=false)). So it would be difficult to open a commercially viable restaurant based on either current Native eating habits or using some of the more hard-to-access or prepare foods.

We do, however, eat and prepare plenty of foods that stem from traditional Native American cuisine in much of what we regard as wider "American" cuisine. The use of green chili in the Southwest, cornbread/corn pone ([the word pone itself comes from Eastern Algonquian languages](http://www.talk-lenape.org/results?query=ahp%C3%B2n&amp;lang=lenape)), succotash, the use of filé powder in gumbo, and of course smoked salmon and jerkey are examples. The pit-style form of barbeque is believed to derive from a traditional style of cooking meat observed in the Amerindians from the Caribbean up to as far as New York. So you could say that restaurants serving uniquely American fare already have some native cuisine incorporated into them. As far as whether a Native American restaurant "was ever popular in the US" in the past, prior to say the 2000s, this might be the closest you\'ll get. 

There is definitely growing interest in reviving Native cuisine in the PNW, Canada, and Mid-West US, I believe in part due to increased curriculum focusing on native plants and food preparation at some of the local colleges (like Evergreen State) and Northwest Indian College. Indian Colleges especially seem to be finding creative ways to connect students with their heritage such as in their food science and culinary arts departments. Sources for what they teach include documents like [The Ethnobotany of Western Washington](https://books.google.com/books?id=7Vo3lD_V9JUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ethnobotany+of+western+washington&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj97t3Qy6rXAhUP-GMKHbzMDHIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), in which the food and cultural values of various native plants were recorded for various PNW tribes (interestingly the interviewer tried to discuss each plant with both a man and woman from each tribe, since women were often more familiar with the culinary and medicinal uses and men tended to be more familiar with the plant\'s value for nets or woodworking), and [Buffalo Bird Woman\'s Garden](http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/buffalo/garden/garden.html), which is a direct recounting of a Hidatsa Indian woman\'s descriptions of her village life, food preparation, and agriculture at Like-a-fishhook village prior to 1885. Lots of descriptions of food in that, and it\'s now being used by chefs such as Sean Sherman to recreate native cuisine. His consulting company, [The Souix Chef](http://sioux-chef.com), has been working on this sort of research and promoting healthy native cuisine. Ever since around 2010 there has been increased attempts at Native American restaurants, though because the genre of "Native" fine cuisine is still attempting to define itself, it\'s been challenging for some of the restaurants. Landlords know that it\'s not exactly a Yelp category that most customers will be searching for, so business loans and securing space [can be more challenging than when starting restaurants of other cuisines](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/why-its-hard-for-successful-native-american-restaurants-to-expand/489449/). There are debates as to how closely Native American cuisine should stick to its historic roots. And items such as the frybread at the National Museum has been [controversial](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/frybread-79191/?no-ist) due to its origins as an essentially non-nutritious survival staple on reservations--a last resort when they were denied access to traditional ingredients, and a reminder of the injustice. And different tribes, and sometimes each family, has their own way of making and serving it, so it\'s difficult to say whose recipe (if any) should be a representative of a whole continent\'s traditional food, especially since that one Native restaurant might be the only direct experience with Native food that most folks might experience. Still, there\'s increasing research and education on traditional Native American cuisine, as well as increasing public awareness (somewhat, at least in some places) and demand for more unique restaurants, so there\'s all the factors that could hopefully lead to a flourishing new restaurant category.

The idea that America was built on multiculturalism appeared very early. By the 1780s, the term "melting together" was a widespread metaphor in use that was meant to positively portray incoming immigrants. Of course, America had just ousted a foreign power from their backs, so nationalism was running high.  Hamilton, an immigrant from  Nevis, argued vehemently against immigration, arguing that immigrants brought pro-monarchy and ethnic views that would undermine their new, fragile country. He also argued that America\'s bountiful resources and exploding population meant that America didn\'t need to rely on newcomers. From the Hamilton Papers,  Examination Number VIII, Jan 12th, 1802:

*In the infancy of the country, with a boundless waste to people, it was politic to give a facility to naturalization; but our situation is now changed. It appears from the last census, that we have increased about one third in ten years; after allowing for what we have gained from abroad, it will be quite apparent that the natural progress of our own population is sufficiently rapid for strength, security and settlement.*

At first, the two dominant parties of the time (Federalists and Democratic-Republicans) mostly agreed on keeping out immigrants. Thomas Jefferson wrote in his *Notes on the State of Virginia* in 1781 that foreigners would be anti-Democracy. However, by the turn of the 19th century, the Democratic-Republicans viewed pro-immigration policies as a great way to undermine the Federalists.

See, Hamilton and the Federalists were afraid of the French, who were at the time being led by Napoleon after the bloody French Revolution. Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans pursued pro-French policy—and more proactive foreign relations with other countries—which included immigration. Jefferson saw immigrants as future voters for the Democratic-Republican party. As with many of these social issues, divisions in public opinion came from the very top, so voters tended to side with their party\'s views. So pro-immigration stances tended to saturate more educated Democratic-Republicans. The election of 1800 was a particularly nasty affair, as the battle lines between both sides slung serious vitriol to get their candidates elected. John Adams, the Federalist incumbent, faced off a challenge against Jefferson. Adams was pro-class and cultural hierarchy, while Jefferson wanted to model the country\'s Democracy on the new post-revolution French model.

It should be pointed out that both Adams and Jefferson saw the 1800 election as a fight over America\'s soul—that the election would set in stone the standards for how America would treat the subject of immigration for the rest of time. Jefferson would later write: *The revolution of 1800... was as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of \'76 was in its form.*

Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican allies would use the melting together metaphor extensively in their campaigning, making 1800 probably the biggest pivot on pro-immigrant sentiment for the general public as self-identified D-R party members adopted Jefferson\'s messages.

Finally, the D-R party wasn\'t free from bias, and fought internally (and extensively) over what type of immigration was considered acceptable by them:

*The meaning of the recently popularized concept of the melting pot was subject to ongoing debate which centered on the issue of immigration. The debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted American society and on how immigrants should be approached. The melting pot was equated with either the acculturation of the total assimilation of European immigrants, and the debate centered on the differences between these two ways of approaching immigration: \'Was the idea to melt down the immigrants and then pour the resulting, formless liquid into the preexisting cultural and social molds modeled on Anglo-Protestants like Henry Ford and Woodrow Wilson, or was the idea instead that everyone, Mayflower descendants and Sicilians, Ashkenazi and Slovaks, would act chemically upon each other so that all would be changed, and a new compound would emerge?* (Baofu, 21-22)

The term "melting together," and other various close iterations of the same idea, was solidified in the public\'s vernacular as "melting pot" in 1908, when the play *The Melting Pot* by Israel Zangwill was released and became popular.

Edit: Thank you for correctly pointing out that Hamilton was from  Nevis, not Puerto Rico.

Many of California\'s new gold rush prospectors arrived to find out there wasn\'t much in the way left for them to make their fortunes.  So while the first arrivals didn\'t mind the Chinese when there was enough gold to go around for everyone--when it started to run dry, the resentment began to build.  The Miners Tax ended up failing and led to the dying of Chinese gold camps which led to an influx of low cost Chinese laborers in cities.  

California Governor John Bigler saw political value in attacking the “coolie” laborers and reinstated the failed tax.  The term "coolie" was supposed to imply these were low skilled and low wage slave laborers who are taking American jobs for their "master" back in China but these people were actually free.  The word itself comes from two Chinese words, “koo” meaning to rent, and “lee” meaning muscle.

This was a tough economic period in part due to the discovery of Australian gold.  In 1854 the California Supreme Court declared that the 1850 statute prohibiting Negroes and Indians from testifying for or against a White person applied also to Chinese for the reason that in the days of Columbus all of the countries washed by Chinese waters had been called “Indian.”

Most of the Chinese came on an arrangement similar to some of the first settlers where they pay back the trip fees plus interest with the wages from their first job.  Unfortunately, this led to many of them not being able to afford to bring their wives and created an enormous prostitution industry for Asian women and comments by Americans heroes like this.  

&gt;While this is being done I invite the attention of Congress to another, though perhaps no less an evil--the importation of Chinese women, but few of whom are brought to our shores to pursue honorable or useful occupations.

Ulysses S. Grant 

The Page Act of 1875  was the first federal anti immigration law that intended to ban all "Coolie labor".  Only the restrictions on female Asians were heavily enforced. 

Things got economically bad after 1877 and led to Chinese establishments being sacked and burned and Chinese being shot and hung.  They saw that the Chinese had monopolized multiple manual labor industries like laundry, construction and landscaping for wages they couldn\'t beat and reacted poorly.  

In 1882 the government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act that banned all Chinese immigration for ten years. 

One of the common themes of these acts and laws that were passed is economic climate.  In harsher times people seemed far more likely to lash out at those deemed different enough.

In the next two decades and in the early 1900\'s we started to see more of a rise of anti immigration sentiment towards southern and eastern European groups like the Catholics (Irish, Polish, Italians) as well as Jewish people though it would continue to increase after the great depression and around WW2.

That\'s when the fun happened and their white neighbors lost their minds at the sight of white babies adopted by Mexican-Americans.

America didn’t really start off as an Immigrant country. The first colonies that were formed at Virginia and Massachusetts were formed in 1607 and 1620 respectively. Given that the modern-day USA was born in 1776, that’s 156 years of life in the continent, and enough for your grandchildren to naturalize in any country by today’s standards. Even by 1770 when Massachusetts was declared under martial law instead of more lenient taxing, most of the colonial leaders hoped to “reconcile with the British Government” rather than declare independence. By this time, the colonists weren’t colonists or immigrants anymore, but the people who were born on the east coast who built this country from almost scratch, including all the good and bad things that has happened.


These original colonists didn’t come here for no reason at all though. Catholicism was restricting freedoms throughout Europe and some immigrants came to escape this religious persecution to practice Puritanism (This is a completely different subject that requires a different research). Most of them came as indentured servants, slaves for pay for a predetermined amount of time, because the price to sail was too steep. These servants ranged from white Europeans to black West Africans. By the time of the Civil War, there were a continuous influx of people from across the Atlantic to the states, which all came either as slaves or indentured servants from all walks of life. 


All the way until the declaration of independence and the civil war, the US was known in the world as a place with “class mobility”, where you can work your way into the upper class and become rich and elite. The US promised freedom to practice your own religion, your own language. The colonial Pennsylvania is a good example of how it’s founder, William Penn envisioned a utopian society where diversity would beget tolerance. 


Migration was a part of the colonial American life. Americans themselves migrated every 10 years to different colonies, including people like Bejamin Franklin, so up until the beginning of the 18th century, immigration was considered a part of American life, and even the naturalized born and raised Americans were migrating. As the number of people who came to America on their own slowly diminished, and the slaves and indentured workers were transported accordingly, the states delved into more important matters, like declaring independence and fighting for it, and the age of colonialism in North America came to an end as a baby nation with all the turmoils of making one arose in its stead, full of Protestant and Puritans who were promised liberty and riches, but received varying levels of these promises. These people were in a time where immigration didn’t have the connotations it had today. An immigrant was a self-made man who fought for what he wanted and didn’t take no for an answer. An immigrant was an opportunist, a hard worker, a strongman who took care of his family in the most ideal fashion. 


Years of life in the states slowly eroded this image of the immigrant as the settlers settled, cities grew and the economy and jobs expanded. With the constitution came law, but not yet order. Americans owned and ran American properties, and new slaves and workers shipped across the Atlantic did the blue collar work. 


This was the type of country the US was when the conditions across Europe worsened as the US’s economy grew. Shipment of people to the states were around 60000 for more than 50 years until the famine in Ireland and political turmoil in Germany, which boosted these numbers dramatically. In 1851, there were 380000 people in the US ports of entry, a very dramatic increase in the consistent influx of humans. 2.7 million new prospective citizens entered the country in the next 7 years, and most of these people were Catholic in a time where Catholicism was hated in the US. There were stark opposition to Catholic churches and schools, but these immigrants had bigger problems. They drew hostility because of the diseases they brought with them from the old world. They were poor, just like the original immigrants but instead of improving the forests of Massachusetts into a sprawling city, they diminished its features with the slum housing they stayed in, the increase in crime rates, alcoholism and other misdemeanors. The American-Born protestants thought their English heritage was true Americanism and despised the Irish and the German. These people were called “nativists”, who believed opposition to the Catholics was necessary to protect America. The Know-Nothings, a political organization that was created by these nativists managed to become the second most powerful political organization in the nation, electing 5 senators and 43 representatives. After the civil war, nativist activity declined dramatically.


So to finally answer your question, anti-immigration sentiment arose from immigrants themselves because they viewed new immigrants as fundamentally different from themselves or their families. America undoubtedly was a melting pot, but this did not exclude people from making the distinction between cultures. Blacks were slaves, Irish were poor, Brits were true Americans etc. and anti-immigration is a very broad term for everyone who came to the US. Immigrants were slaves, immigrants were cheap labor, immigrants were Catholics, Immigrants were nation builders, and different groups had different expectations from these immigrants. Given all of these distinctions, it isn’t inherently illogical to say that immigrants are anti-immigration without including themselves. It is important to realize that actions have different consequences in different contexts, and some immigration is inherently more useful than others.


America, for most people, is the melting pot of the “correct” cultures. 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________



Just as an extra, here are some examples of anti-immigration that happened in the US throughout its history:


“Yet as industrial revolution transformed the United States in the postwar years and attracted a vast new influx of immigrants, the antialien animus rose again. In the 1870s more than 2.7 million newcomers arrived at U.S. ports.”


“more than eighty thousand immigrants from China arrived between 1870 and 1875, brought to America by companies that had contracted to supply cheap labor to mines, railways, and other enterprises needing unskilled labor. With 30 percent of California’s workforce unemployed following the panic of 1873, many workers attacked these newcomers as “coolies” willing to work for slave wages. Outbreaks of violence against the Chinese spread throughout the West, from Los Angeles to Seattle to Denver. In 1882, Congress responded to anti-Asian nativism with the Chinese Exclusion Act, which suspended immigration from China for ten years.”


“A striking number of new nativist fraternal groups were formed, the most important being the American Protective Association (APA). Founded in Iowa in 1887, the APA had attracted a membership of 500,000 by 1895.”


“By the end of the nineteenth century, the APA had disappeared. Nativist activism did not flourish in the first decades of the twentieth century, the years of the Progressive Era. It rose again in the form of the post-World War I Red Scare in 1919, and in the powerful but short-lived Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. It was in the nineteenth century that antialien movements had their greatest impact in American history.”

&gt; How did anti-immigration sentiment arise from a literal nation of immigrants?

By the 20th century, the United States was culturally monopolized by the descendants of the Anglo-Saxon, Western European "Old Stock" originators and immigrants alike. The idea of the "Melting Pot" was created as a a way to promote their version of "American" culture. They viewed themselves as the progenitors of "being American" so all who came after should conform to their form of "American" and basically give up the ethnic culture from where they came from. The anti-immigrant sentiment wasn\'t so much anti *immigrant* so much as it was fear of others who are different. The Melting Pot meant that this diversity would accumulate into one distinct culture, which according to people like Horace Kallen and Randolph Bourne, is just a ridiculous idea. America to them should be a dynamic place that used its diversity (in the rise of a growing nationalism in Europe at the time) as a strength, placing American values above any one culture or ethnicity.

Horace Kallen in his work *Democracy Versus the Melting Pot (1915)* describes the ethnic makeup and its evolution *at length* and does not shy away from calling this "Old Stock" group out for its hypocrisy. Combined with Randolph Bourne\'s *Trans-Nationalism*, both are great reads, delving into the idea of "American," not as an ethnicity, but as a way of being. That being \'American" was to follow a set of ideals and that retaining ones own culture (cultural pluralism) was not at odds with this. This was directly countering the idea that being "American" should be homogeneous culturally. 

&gt; How did the idea of America as a melting pot of different cultures develop in spite anti-immigrant sentiment?

People tend to live near like groups. As more and more immigrants came to the United States, large communities formed. In Kallen\'s *Democracy Versus the Melting Pot*, he explains that immigrants ultimately had to conform out of economic necessity (learning English, etc) so of course a base American culture was adhered to, but in the end, it actually allowed for cultural diversity to flourish as all of these new groups interacted and brought their norms to the US and their children and grandchildren became more culturally homogenous.

An example of this Anglo-Saxon stock forced Melting Pot was Henry Ford. [I\'ll just leave this here.](http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Labor/L_Overview/FordEnglishSchool.htm)

Overall, the answer to your question is that there was a general disdain of other cultures as inferior or foreign to a large group of people who had been relatively culturally homogeneous with themselves and with western Europe until about the 1880s when America began to industrialize in earnest attracting the masses.

No, we have absolutely nothing even remotely resembling statistics, and just because in the past century or several there\'s been a noticeable increase in myopia doesn\'t itself say anything about medieval western Europe (what I\'ll be talking about here). However, medieval popular Christianity relied on *visuality* in some pretty basic ways I\'m not sure it would have if 50% of some such of people couldn\'t see their own shoes. "Art is the book of the illiterate" was a basic philosophy of religious instruction. Church sculpture, mosaic, decorated rood screens, stained glass were meant to glorify God but also to instruct (hence the popularity of Last Judgment scenes over the tympanum). And watching the priest consume the Eucharist (bread and wine) could substitute for the person doing it themselves--even in the case of a saint like Nicholas von Flue.

But we also know that some people were indeed nearsighted, and obviously eyesight deteriorated in various ways (presbyopia/farsightedness, AMD, cataracts, etc) with ageing. I want to briefly introduce a distinction that scholars of disability and medicine make between "impairment" and "disability." Impairment *in this sense* is used as a deviation from the normative (not from the normal! lots of things are normal); disability refers to when an impairment affects someone\'s functioning in the world. Here, I\'m going to talk more on managing visual impairment to minimize (not necessarily eliminate) disability.


This being the Middle Ages, obviously the first way people tried to cope was by praying for miracles. And indeed, miracle stories attached to saints and shrines offer some really interesting cases of the extreme end of visual impairment that\'s "not quite blindness," although we should keep in mind that "blind" is a subjective term that means different things in different contexts.

Two important themes that arise from miracle stories are the effect on mobility and on ability to work. One of St. Elisabeth of Hungary\'s miracles concerns a girl who, it\'s clear, has some vision but only a little; the story emphasizes that she can\'t even see well enough to find her way on a path. (Medieval "roads" could just be a trampled line through fields). There\'s a similar miracle concerning a middle-aged man who developed possibly cataracts (*macula*, stains) and similarly couldn\'t find his way on a path; he reported being ridiculed for it. 

In these cases, the key was to lean on the support of other people. We read a lot about blind and otherwise visually impaired people being "led" to shrines. That\'s probably the single most common theme in anecdotes of people with disabilities in the Middle Ages--the ad hoc, case-by-case reliance on friends and family, or in a few cases monastic charity.

With respect to work, it seems that in a lot of cases the key was to find a task a person could perform. The miracles of St. Bertin tell of one evidently nearsighted man who couldn\'t see well enough to perform outdoor manual labor, but up very close could still see well enough to do needlework. So he sat with the women of the duke\'s household all day, working on embroidery and weaving!

The later Middle Ages did have knowledge of and practice rudimentary cataract surgery, sometimes even successfully. In 1351, aging abbot Gilles le Muisit of St. Martin\'s in Tournai had his cataracts removed only to find that behind them, he was farsighted:

&gt; I saw not as in my young age but as my age demanded, because I was
already an octogenarian, and I saw the sky, the sun, the moon, the
stars, though not perfectly recognizing people, and I saw everything at
a distance from me very well, but I was not able to write or read.

The first "glasses", which were designed to be held rather than worn, were for reading (i.e. for farsightedness). [Here\'s a photo](https://imgur.com/a/7KRHt) I took in the Dominican church museum in Eisenach of a 1510 altarpiece relief from Thuringia--the scene is the death of the Virgin Mary, and the man with the book and glasses is probably supposed to be a physician. Glasses were one type of iconographic shorthand for physicians (another being a flask filled with urine. You do you, Middle Ages.)

Ronald Finucane and Irina Metzler have both pointed out that we are much less likely to read about nobles with disabling conditions. There was then as there is now a stigma attached to disability, even more so because of the stronger link between sin (moral failure) and impairment. So even in miracle stories that *do* involve knights and other nobles, the recorder will allow the healed to express a sense of shame--even to the point of feeling suicidal, in one case--a consciousness of emotion denied to lower classes. 

That was the case with the knight Gilbert, whose story is told in the miracle of St. Foy. *Twice in a row* he received a head injury in combat--once while, apparently, breaking up a barfight--that caused vision problems. And he was, given the source, miraculously healed in several stages. (Draw your own medical conclusions.)

But one of the most interesting cases hops way above the others. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in the 13th century--the one who looked at the Crusades, said "I got u, fam" and *negotiated* his way into taking over Jerusalem from Muslim control--actually dealt with developing myopia over the course of his life. This could have been a hardship for him, as his true love was hunting. (He embarked on very few building projects over the course of his reign, but these included several hunting lodges, which is also where he preferred to spend much of his time). What did he do? He still hunted with great enthusiasm, apparently. But then, hunting in the Middle Ages wasn\'t about food (unless you were desperate and poaching), it was about power and masculinity and status and probably blowing off some steam. So even in the parts where humans didn\'t rely on their dogs and birds to do the work for them, perhaps there was not as much pressure to perform.

But then, of course, there\'s the ultimate solution. Can\'t fight like a knight, can\'t hunt as well as you want to?

Write a book about it.

And Frederick did.',

&lt;p&gt;I saw not as in my young age but as my age demanded, because I was
already an octogenarian, and I saw the sky, the sun, the moon, the
stars, though not perfectly recognizing people, and I saw everything at
a distance from me very well, but I was not able to write or read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first &amp;quot;glasses&amp;quot;, which were designed to be held rather than worn, were for reading (i.e. for farsightedness). &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/7KRHt"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a photo&lt;/a&gt; I took in the Dominican church museum in Eisenach of a 1510 altarpiece relief from Thuringia--the scene is the death of the Virgin Mary, and the man with the book and glasses is probably supposed to be a physician. Glasses were one type of iconographic shorthand for physicians (another being a flask filled with urine. You do you, Middle Ages.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ronald Finucane and Irina Metzler have both pointed out that we are much less likely to read about nobles with disabling conditions. There was then as there is now a stigma attached to disability, even more so because of the stronger link between sin (moral failure) and impairment. So even in miracle stories that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; involve knights and other nobles, the recorder will allow the healed to express a sense of shame--even to the point of feeling suicidal, in one case--a consciousness of emotion denied to lower classes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the case with the knight Gilbert, whose story is told in the miracle of St. Foy. &lt;em&gt;Twice in a row&lt;/em&gt; he received a head injury in combat--once while, apparently, breaking up a barfight--that caused vision problems. And he was, given the source, miraculously healed in several stages. (Draw your own medical conclusions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one of the most interesting cases hops way above the others. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in the 13th century--the one who looked at the Crusades, said &amp;quot;I got u, fam&amp;quot; and &lt;em&gt;negotiated&lt;/em&gt; his way into taking over Jerusalem from Muslim control--actually dealt with developing myopia over the course of his life. This could have been a hardship for him, as his true love was hunting. (He embarked on very few building projects over the course of his reign, but these included several hunting lodges, which is also where he preferred to spend much of his time). What did he do? He still hunted with great enthusiasm, apparently. But then, hunting in the Middle Ages wasn&amp;#39;t about food (unless you were desperate and poaching), it was about power and masculinity and status and probably blowing off some steam. So even in the parts where humans didn&amp;#39;t rely on their dogs and birds to do the work for them, perhaps there was not as much pressure to perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, of course, there&amp;#39;s the ultimate solution. Can&amp;#39;t fight like a knight, can&amp;#39;t hunt as well as you want to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a book about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Frederick did.&lt;/p&gt;

Yeltsin could have undoubtedly found out the contents of the average American grocery had he cared to. It\'s doubtful the United States would have exerted much effort to stop him from discovering Pudding Pops or Coca-Cola. But Yeltsin never had any reason to. It was simply never relevant. Do you think Donald Trump or Obama have ever shopped in a Chinese supermarket? Probably not. It\'s just not relevant to their lives.

Yeltsin also probably had statistics on standards of living available to him. But it\'s another thing to actually see and experience it. In addition, coming from the Soviet world where statistics were often... dubious if not outright fabricated, he had at least some reason to be suspicious.

Now, onto the context. What is not open for debate: Yeltsin did indeed visit an American grocery store. He had, by all reports, a grand time. He tried some of the wares and the manager gave him some free food to take with him. He inquired about the food distribution system and how managers were chosen. He was deeply affected by this and repeatedly commented on how much better the standards of living in the US were, both to people there and to his aides. Likewise, Yeltsin\' assessment that the United States was wealthier and did a better job providing for its people was simply objectively correct. There is some controversy on this point by Soviet apologists, but I\'m not aware of any mainstream historian who disagrees. (There are reasons for this other than Communism, but this does not change the standards of living themselves.)

All this is attested to by multiple sources who tell the same broad story with only a few minor contradictions or unverified reports. One aide, for example, recalls Yeltsin planned to open his own chain of grocery stores on this model, and spoke about grocery stores as the fundament of the modern world. While this is not mentioned in other reports, it doesn\'t really introduce ambiguity into the narrative. It broadly agrees with the other accounts and doesn\'t contradict them in a meaningful way.

But let\'s pull back a little. Because this incident didn\'t come out of nowhere. The Soviet Union and the United States had been competing on the standards of living for decades, going back to the \'50s. Before Yeltsin visited the supermarket there were multiple incidents like the Kitchen Debates and other displays where both sides tried to outdo each other in living standards. In reality, the United States was always ahead but the Soviet Union was willing to lie to make it seem otherwise. From time to time, someone would expose this and embarrass the Soviets.

By making a surprise visit and comparing conditions, Yeltsin was acting in a tradition that would have been familiar both at home and in the United States. The surprise was that Yeltsin openly admitted his side wasn\'t winning. *That* had never happened before.

Why did he do that? Well, he says in part because it was true. And it certainly was true. But, and I have no citation for this, politicians lie. And (I do have a citation for this) the Soviets lied all the time to make themselves look better. Why the reversal?

The pat little story is that Yeltsin saw this grocery store and decided to fight Communism. This has no historical evidence: the reforms began in 1986 (three years before) and Gorbachev explicitly wanted to preserve Communism. Yeltsin was a critic but was not, at the time, explicitly anti-communist. The context was instead of a world where Gorbachev was trying to thaw relations with the United States and reform/revitalize the Soviet Union. He was a reformer doing battle with hardliners at home while trying to keep liberals from tearing the Soviet Union apart. And Yeltsin was a reformer.

By losing one of these \'kitchen debates\' (for lack of a better term) he was damaging the conservatives who didn\'t want to admit the Soviet Union was behind while encouraging his own reformists. It was an attempt to show he was willing to break with previous policy and tradition to force the Soviet system to be examined and reformed. At the same time, hardliners would be put in the awkward position of having to lie without the support of the Soviet government (as a result of Gorbachev\'s reforms). And without that support, their lies would be much more apparent. It would also warm relations with the west at a time when the Soviet Union was vulnerable (and where Gorbachev was trying to warm the relations).

But none of this answers the more personal question. This is more an explanation of why friendliness to the West fit well into his general program. *Why* did the visit affect him like this? Yeltsin undoubtedly had more power, prestige, and luxuries than anyone else in that store.

In short, because Yeltsin was a Soviet.

It\'s easy to dismiss people with different belief systems as either secretly believing what we believe or believing in some more base philosophy. For example, saying that Stalin\'s actions were not *really* about Communism but about power. No one could *really* believe that, could they? Well, usually, yes. They could and did. And Yeltsin\'s autobiography shows that he really, truly believed in Communism. But he believed it in a specific way: he believed it was *right*, that it was better for the working class. And this was blatant, empirical proof that the United States was beating them in providing for the working class. This is what he tells us himself.

And that genuinely shocked him.

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for the great response! I\'ve edited a few grammar mistakes.',
'body_html' => '&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a matter of knowing versus comprehension. It&amp;#39;s also a matter of practicality. Yeltsin could have undoubtedly found out the contents of the average American grocery had he cared to. It&amp;#39;s doubtful the United States would have exerted much effort to stop him from discovering Pudding Pops or Coca-Cola. But Yeltsin never had any reason to. It was simply never relevant. Do you think Donald Trump or Obama have ever shopped in a Chinese supermarket? Probably not. It&amp;#39;s just not relevant to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeltsin also probably had statistics on standards of living available to him. But it&amp;#39;s another thing to actually see and experience it. In addition, coming from the Soviet world where statistics were often... dubious if not outright fabricated, he had at least some reason to be suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the context. What is not open for debate: Yeltsin did indeed visit an American grocery store. He had, by all reports, a grand time. He tried some of the wares and the manager gave him some free food to take with him. He inquired about the food distribution system and how managers were chosen. He was deeply affected by this and repeatedly commented on how much better the standards of living in the US were, both to people there and to his aides. Likewise, Yeltsin&amp;#39; assessment that the United States was wealthier and did a better job providing for its people was simply objectively correct. There is some controversy on this point by Soviet apologists, but I&amp;#39;m not aware of any mainstream historian who disagrees. (There are reasons for this other than Communism, but this does not change the standards of living themselves.)&lt;/p&gt;

Skiosmagus does quite a nice job contextualizing the anecdote and how it has become mythologized in the USSR\'s own self-image. It would be really great if we had someone come along who could contextualize Yeltsin\'s own account of it in his autobiography (how trustworthy is he? what images of himself, the USSR, and Russia was he using his life narrative to project? &amp;c).

It would be really great if we had someone come along who could contextualize Yeltsin&amp;#39;s own account of it in his autobiography (how trustworthy is he? what images of himself, the USSR, and Russia was he using his life narrative to project? &amp;amp;c).&lt;/p&gt;

'body' => 'A reasonable trawl through the Internet will inform you that American universities borrowed the terminology from Oxford and Cambridge, where they had come to describe different levels of "sophester" or sophist--someone who *thinks they are* wise. (Sophomore adds on either a simple Latin -or \'operator\' ending, or *possibly* Greek *moros*/fool--either way, the meaning is clear; the adjective "sophomoric" means immature). In the sixteenth century, *sophister* sometimes had an additional connotation of someone who takes money for teaching wisdom instead of ~~being an exploited adjunct~~ living a pure life of the mind or something--basically, a philosopher who sold out. This would track with the use of more advanced students employed to tutor earlier ones.

What the OED and blog posts *won\'t* tell you, on the other hand, is why the labels for students are inherently *insults*.

Medieval universities incubated a tradition that early modern ones would carry on with pride: periodically awful student behavior. (Also, you know, excellent academics &amp; drool-worthy libraries &amp; the foundation for modern scientific research &amp;c &amp;c.) Most infamous is student violence, of course--right along with universities\' determination to shelter their own from charges of murder and rape.

But more to the point with the classifications is that university students also had a reputation for living up to a somewhat lower standard than what Robert Lowth wanted to see in Oxford:

&gt; [A place] where a liberal pursuit of knowledge, and a genuine freedom
of thought was raised encouraged and pushed forward by
example, by commendation, and by authority

and somewhat more along the lines of what Edward Gibbon (yes, [our Edward Gibbon!](https://books.google.com/books?id=9fELAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA26&amp;lpg=RA2-PA26&amp;dq=To+the+university+of+Oxford+I+acknowledge+no+obligation;+and+she+will+as+cheerfully+renounce+me+for+a+son&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Uzr90PgSM5&amp;sig=X1F1rSTQayQuESXUUz9fTxZzfug&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI7_21xt3YAhVPA6wKHXg2DSYQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=To%20the%20university%20of%20Oxford%20I%20acknowledge%20no%20obligation%3B%20and%20she%20will%20as%20cheerfully%20renounce%20me%20for%20a%20son&amp;f=false)) remembered:

&gt; To the university of Oxford I acknowledge no obligation;
and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother. I spent fourteen months
at Magdalen College; they proved the fourteen months the
most idle and unprofitable of my whole life...

&gt; In the
university of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors
have for these many years given up altogether even the
pretence of teaching.

&gt; As
a gentleman commoner, I was admitted to the society of the
fellows, and fondly expected that some questions of literature
would be the amusing and instructive topics of their discourse.
Their conversation stagnated in a round of college business,
Tory politics, personal anecdotes, and private scandal...The names of Wenman and Dashwood were more frequently
pronounced, than those of Cicero and Chrysostom.

The point isn\'t that there were no deeply studious students making serious academic gains of their own and scientific progress overall, it\'s the *reputation* they had for being--well, *sophists*: more concerned with the social life of debate and politics and looking/acting smart to each other, than living up to some lofty ideal. Oxford opened its first coffeehouse in 1650. And by early modern coffeehouse, we should mean something like a literary salon--a place where the literati would gather to discuss intellectual topics and current events.

Of course, to contemporary eyes, this was a great deficit from what it should be. A 1901 investigation of Oxford in the 18th century summed up its findings in this description of freshman, freshly-minted college men:

&gt; We see the public schoolman, just freed from the rod of
Busby’s successors, strutting about town for a week or so
before entrance, courting his schoolfellows’ envy...swaggering
at coffee-houses, and giving himself a scholar’s airs at the
bookshops.

and things did not improve over the years:

&gt; A month or two sees them metamorphosed into complete smarts...The "smart\'s" breakfast is scarcely over by ten.

It\'s important to keep in mind that these attitudes were not only *external* in the sense of town-gown relations or alumni making a point about the quality of English universities compared to continental ones. Student university hazing could be absolutely brutal. Internal university hierarchy, built upon the idea that students with less experience were complete no-nothing fools, reigned supreme.

Most infamously, there\'s a late medieval sort of "Latin textbook" for university students that consists of a series of dialogues we think were meant to teach students useful Latin vocabulary for surviving uni daily life. One of the settings is a violent and humiliating initiation ritual in which the freshman or *beanus* is made into an animal that must be tamed. Well, scholars will continue to dispute whether in the 15th century this was a literary fantasy that drew on a solid tradition of hazing. On the other hand, there seems to be fairly solid evidence that early modern students at some universities took the *description* as *prescription*--and performed the hazing ceremony.

The straightforward etymologies of sophomore, junior (sophister), and senior (sophister) from Greek *sophia* and Greek/Latin *sophister*, in other words, aren\'t really the interesting part of the story--and a much funnier one for those of us who never attended college or have already graduated.',

In an [1898 address](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25104305?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) to The Bar Association, Simeon E. Baldwin provided an overview of the history of legal education in America, and included a section on Harvard and Yale. He explained to the group that John Harvard was a graduate of Cambridge University, and organized his college like his alma mater: three terms a year for three years, students grouped into Freshmen, Junior Sophisters, and Senior Sophisters. 15 years later, a "Sophimore" year was added after the first year.

Cambridge University, does in fact, claims the term Sophisters as [jargon unique to them](https://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/life-at-queens/about-the-college/university/the-jargon) and an 1841 history of the university references a 1726 report by three tutors from the university in which they describe students\' courses [1]: 
&gt;While the students are Freshmen, they commonly recite the Grammars....
&gt; The Sophomores recite Burgersdicius\'s Logic....
&gt;The Junior Sophisters recite Heereboord\'s Meletemata... 
&gt;The Senior Sophisters, besides Arithmetic, recite Allsted\'s Geometry .....

A report filed in 1766 used the same categories for the four classes. Likewise, the laws of Yale University in [1800](https://books.google.com/books?id=TEMbAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=The%20laws%20of%20yale-college%201800&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20laws%20of%20yale-college%201800&amp;f=false) required students be organized into four distinct classes: Freshmen, Sophomores, Junior Sophisters, and Senior Sophisters. 

By [1833](https://books.google.com/books?id=dt8TAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=1833%20Harvard%20tutor%20report&amp;pg=RA2-PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=Freshmen&amp;f=false), Harvard had dropped the word "Sophisters" and referred to the four levels as Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors. Yale dropped it by 1843. It doesn\'t appear as if the modifier caught on at New York State colleges such as King\'s College (later Columbia) or Barnard. The earliest annual reports to the Regents reported only college names, not enrollment, but when the report did begin to breakout emrollment by years, the [1845 report](https://books.google.com/books?id=X0UFAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=new%20york%20board%20of%20regents%20report%201825&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) authors used the four familiar monikers. Eventually, like the mortarboard and lecture hall, the names for students in each of the four years became part of the ether and culture of American colleges. 

Tracing the labels use in American high schools is a bit more complicated. While there were some academies and private schools that modeled themselves after colleges in the 1700\'s and 1800\'s, students didn\'t typically complete four years of secondary school immediately following 8 years of grammar school. Instead, young men typically attended two years of secondary school or just long enough to acquire the knowledge necessary to pass college admissions tests. Four-year public high schools did exist, but they were mostly in cities and more frequently attended by girls than boys. It wasn\'t until the 1890\'s that the more familiar four-year structure of American high schools began to spread and take form.

The work of the National Education Association\'s Committee of Ten on Secondary School Studies reflected a growing desire to create a cohesive look for secondary public education in America. Their final reports, issued in [1894](https://books.google.com/books?id=PfcBAAAAYAAJ&amp;num=13), mapped out various paths students could take and referred to the four years as: 1st Secondary School Year, 2nd Secondary School Year, 3rd Secondary School Year, and 4th Secondary School Year. The Committee was advocating for an 8 + 4 model (8 years of grammar school plus 4 years of secondary school) and their word choice reflects that proposal.

However, there are multiple examples of schools using the labels before high school became common. An 1772 article in the Virginia Gazette, includes the following dispatch from Princeton, New Jersey:
&gt; On Monday the 28th, the Grammar School at Nassau Hall was examined, and the Scholars acquitted themselves greatly to the Satisfaction of the Gentlemen who were pleased to attend. The Senior Class [from the Grammar School], ten in number, were admitted into the Freshmen class in the College.

Additoinally, Philadelphia\'s Central High School, the country\'s second oldest public high school, has described its student bodies by Freshmen, Sophomore, Junior, Senior seemingly since its founding in 1836. Finally, Lahainaluna High School in Hawaii, the oldest American high school founded west of the Mississippi, was mentioned in an article in 1888 that described students from the freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior classes. Lahainaluna was founded by William Richards and Lorrin Andrews, missionaries from New England who advocated for an American education for Hawaiian children, which suggests that through acculturation and familiarity, the grade-level titles had become firmly entrenched in the American conscious for both colleges and high schools.

Likewise, the laws of Yale University in &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=TEMbAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;dq=The%20laws%20of%20yale-college%201800&amp;amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=The%20laws%20of%20yale-college%201800&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;1800&lt;/a&gt; required students be organized into four distinct classes: Freshmen, Sophomores, Junior Sophisters, and Senior Sophisters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=dt8TAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;dq=1833%20Harvard%20tutor%20report&amp;amp;pg=RA2-PA6#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Freshmen&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;1833&lt;/a&gt;, Harvard had dropped the word &amp;quot;Sophisters&amp;quot; and referred to the four levels as Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors. Yale dropped it by 1843. It doesn&amp;#39;t appear as if the modifier caught on at New York State colleges such as King&amp;#39;s College (later Columbia) or Barnard. The earliest annual reports to the Regents reported only college names, not enrollment, but when the report did begin to breakout emrollment by years, the &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=X0UFAAAAQAAJ&amp;amp;dq=new%20york%20board%20of%20regents%20report%201825&amp;amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;1845 report&lt;/a&gt; authors used the four familiar monikers. Eventually, like the mortarboard and lecture hall, the names for students in each of the four years became part of the ether and culture of American colleges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracing the labels use in American high schools is a bit more complicated. While there were some academies and private schools that modeled themselves after colleges in the 1700&amp;#39;s and 1800&amp;#39;s, students didn&amp;#39;t typically complete four years of secondary school immediately following 8 years of grammar school. Instead, young men typically attended two years of secondary school or just long enough to acquire the knowledge necessary to pass college admissions tests. Four-year public high schools did exist, but they were mostly in cities and more frequently attended by girls than boys. It wasn&amp;#39;t until the 1890&amp;#39;s that the more familiar four-year structure of American high schools began to spread and take form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the National Education Association&amp;#39;s Committee of Ten on Secondary School Studies reflected a growing desire to create a cohesive look for secondary public education in America. Their final reports, issued in &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PfcBAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;num=13"&gt;1894&lt;/a&gt;, mapped out various paths students could take and referred to the four years as: 1st Secondary School Year, 2nd Secondary School Year, 3rd Secondary School Year, and 4th Secondary School Year. The Committee was advocating for an 8 + 4 model (8 years of grammar school plus 4 years of secondary school) and their word choice reflects that proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are multiple examples of schools using the labels before high school became common. An 1772 article in the Virginia Gazette, includes the following dispatch from Princeton, New Jersey:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday the 28th, the Grammar School at Nassau Hall was examined, and the Scholars acquitted themselves greatly to the Satisfaction of the Gentlemen who were pleased to attend. The Senior Class [from the Grammar School], ten in number, were admitted into the Freshmen class in the College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additoinally, Philadelphia&amp;#39;s Central High School, the country&amp;#39;s second oldest public high school, has described its student bodies by Freshmen, Sophomore, Junior, Senior seemingly since its founding in 1836. Finally, Lahainaluna High School in Hawaii, the oldest American high school founded west of the Mississippi, was mentioned in an article in 1888 that described students from the freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior classes. Lahainaluna was founded by William Richards and Lorrin Andrews, missionaries from New England who advocated for an American education for Hawaiian children, which suggests that through acculturation and familiarity, the grade-level titles had become firmly entrenched in the American conscious for both colleges and high schools.   &lt;/p&gt;

'body' => 'I can talk about several denominations within Christianity in Canada from the 50s onwards. These denominations (spec. Baptists, Mennonites, and CMA/CAMA, tended to be, and still tend to be, more conservative than other groups with Canada, including the RC church, Anglicans, and so on--though the latter are not my area of expertise). Please note that when I refer to "Baptists", I\'m not referring to the Southern Baptist movement within the United States. ~~Rather, I\'m talking about Canadian descendants of the Anabaptist movement in 16C. They may have similar roots but frankly I don\'t know.~~

Putting aside dietary restrictions for a moment, in the third quarter of the 20th century (so 1950-1975) there were strong taboos against men with long hair (1 Cor 11.14) and tattoos (Lev 19.28) in mainstream Baptist, Mennonite, and CMA congregations in Western Canada. Sermons were preached about it in many churches over many years. The same goes for tattoos, which were seen as unacceptable unless a church member were an adult convert. While the taboo against long hair grew less influential in the 80s, the taboo against tattoos lasted longer. 

The question is, to what extent did existing religious norms influence society as a whole, as long hair, certainly, was seen to be a part of youthful rebellion. In smaller communities within AB, BC, and SK (and even larger centres such as Lethbridge), many businesses were simply closed on Sundays during this quarter. I would argue that, the more religious the community, the more influence that the church had upon individual towns, to the extent that Biblical precepts against working on the Sabbath influenced the culture as a greater whole. (Some of those restrictions, closures on Sunday in particular, still have ramifications today, but that\'s beyond the scope of this subreddit.)

Homosexuality within these groups was simply not tolerated, and abortion... well, that\'s an interesting topic, as the laws on abortion in Canada were loosened in 1967 as a result of Pierre Trudeau, himself influenced by the Quiet Revolution in the 60s (which saw a shift in societal values away from the Roman Catholic church and towards secularism). While abortion was quasi-legal at that time, it was still largely decried by many Christian churches within Canada, including Baptists and Mennonite groups, and CAMA/CMA (The Christian and Missionary Alliance). 

There may be individual congregations with exceptions to the above rule, but looking at statements of belief from this era (and God help me but I can\'t find any of my old textbooks in which this was discussed... we\'re talking about mimeograph copies from provincial assemblies of the aforementioned groups, and I have no idea where they are), the above is by and large true.

So: the above groups largely condemned homosexuality (let alone gay marriage) and abortion, as well as tattoos, working on Sundays, and long hair for men. Consistent so far. Back to dietary restrictions: speaking of Christianity, there are no longer any dietary restrictions, period. In Acts 10 &amp; 11, Peter has a vision in which God essentially tells him that it\'s okay to eat anything, that the old dietary laws of the Old Testament no longer applied. This is why Christians in general have no issue with eating anything, and that\'s a blanket statement that applies worldwide (with a few minor exceptions, such as Messianic Jews). 

I understand that this is a very limited answer from a very limited geographical area within North America. I apologise for my lack of sources, but little on this can be found online outside of regional paper archives, and those are spread out and difficult to access on a Sunday afternoon (heh). The texts to which I have access, including *Readings in Baptist History: Four Centuries of Selected Documents* by Joseph Early and *Tracks and Traces: Baptist Identity in Church and Theology* by Paul Fiddes are broader and the former *does* talk about Southern Baptists; this would be a useful resource to look at belief statements from larger organising bodies. My post is related more towards *a posteriori* experiences in individual congregations in the latter part of the 20th century in W. Canada.',

However,\\n\\n&gt;DeLay\\u2019s goal was not to make exegetical or theological sense. It was to declare affiliation with a certain brand of American Christianity.\\n\\nHer essay is full of insights, but one of them is that the Bible is frequently not the text but the subtext of these conversations: the topics these groups emphasize in their public face, as you seem to suspect, seem to be chosen somewhat independently of the emphases of the Biblical text. On these groups\' webpages,\\n\\n&gt;The upper left hand is usually reserved for a donation screen, but then the rest of the left hand menu almost invariably lists the links to such topics as Abortion, Guns, School Prayer, Homosexuality, Persecution, etc. *The Bible is usually not one of them*. It is deliberately submerged; one need not be a poststructuralist to recognize a sub-text, a hypo-text of the hyper-text. [...]On average it takes two or three and sometimes more links even to find a page that mentions the Bible or a biblical verse. \\n\\nShe continues (and remember, a lot of her essay is on the topic of Biblical literalism):\\n\\n&gt;\\u201cThe Christian world-view,\\u201d which is being promoted by a whole range of home-schooling and other cottage industries, is a code-phrase for \\u201cChristianity in our likeness.\\u201d Here from a link on the Dobson web site: \\u201cWhat is a biblical worldview? A biblical worldview is based on the infallible Word of God. When you believe the Bible is entirely true, then you allow it to be the foundation of everything you say and do. That means, for instance, you take seriously the mandate in Romans 13 to honor the governing authorities by researching the candidates and issues, making voting a priority.\\u201d Why is Romans 13 rather than the Beatitudes to be the center of the Christian solar system? As I shall argue below, along with a polemical intent similar to what we see in ancient commentators, *what most characterizes the Christian Right\\u2019s biblical interpretation is no single method, but rather its selection of passages and topics.*\\n\\nFor me, her discussion of the websites\' condemnation of gambling is most interesting because the Bible doesn\'t really have very much to say about gambling. As for the selective, single-minded, and  indeed misleading readings of other topics, Mitchell doesn\'t mince words:\\n\\n&gt;While it is easy to think of this as a literalistic proof-texting, it is not just that, but a highly creative rearrangement of selective pieces of the biblical record to justify a previously reached conclusion (in this case, apparently, the invasion of Iraq). Sometimes Land does include passages that might complicate the picture, but his own interpretive comments draw attention away from them. For example, we read \\u201cRom. 12:2 our ways are separate from the world\\u2019s ways,\\u201d but would hardly realize that under the listing Rom. 12:17-21 lies a text that contains both the actual word peace (Rom. 12:2 does not) and a command related to it: \\u201cif it is possible by your agency, live in peace with all people\\u201d (Rom. 12:18). It bears noting, in relation to my larger thesis, that it is Christian peace-makers of various stripes\\u2014not the Christian Right\\u2014who are the literalists when it comes to the latter verse.\\n\\nNow, I don\'t think Mitchell\'s point is that those on the Christian Right don\'t read their Bibles at all but rather, 1) people on all sides are much too quick to grant them their claimed title of Biblical literalists, 2) they engage in a variety of hermeneutic strategies, not merely literal interpretation of the plain text, 3) at least some of their judgements and analyses are driven by current conservative societal and political norms, rather than emulation of Biblical example. \\n\\n&gt;My thesis is that what makes the Christian Right biblical is not a literalistic hermeneutic so much as a mode of argumentation by reference to a deliberately selective set of biblical passages, annexed to the predetermined cause through a variety of exegetical moves, which are usually unexplained because they depend upon prior agreement of the ends of interpretation. And I have shown examples where there is a lot less biblical study going on than one might expect. The Christian Right represents biblical interpretation in a conjunction of two selective circles: of what are the key issues in the political realm and what are the central passages in the biblical record. It represents an odd alignment of each. The canonical delineation is striking\\u2014a focus on the Old Testament, with special prominence given to Judges and 1 and 2 Chronicles, as well as to Genesis and Leviticus; and in the New Testament, to selected moralizing passages of the Pauline letters and Revelation. It is easy to see then what is missing: the prophets of Israel and the teachings of Jesus (the Gospels). Along with them go concern with social\\/political issues such as economic inequality, peace-making, love and forgiveness, and critique of religious hypocrisy (just to choose a few!).\\n\\nThis, of course, only represents one part of contemporary Protestant Christianity (albeit likely the part most associated with the two issue you mention above). There are certainly other Christian groups--smaller and less publicly oriented--which, like \\/u\\/randomiblis says, emphasize a very different set of Biblical passages: Anabaptists, Hutterites, Quakers, for instance, seem to emphasize the Gospels and Acts much more strongly than the American Christian Right (the Hutterites, for instance, practice a \\"community of goods\\" and own almost no private property, in direct emulation of Acts 2:44-47, 4:32-35, and the other groups form the core of the [historic Peace Churches](https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Peace_churches) who found in the Gospels commendents for complete pacificism).  Preachers coming out of the politically engaged Black Protestant tradition, on the other hand, are much more likely to echo the calls for justice and fairness found in the Prophets than either the sectarian Christians or the Religious Right (\\"But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!\\" Amos 4:24). I once went to a Syriac Easter service in Midyat, Turkey where all the women dutifully covered their heads with gauzy, ethereal veils in accordance with pretty clear instructions of 1 Corinthians 11:4-6 (as soon as they stepped out of the church, they uncovered their heads so as not to be confused with local Arab and Kurdish Muslims).  \\n\\nCertain \\"snake handling\\" Holiness sects in Appalachia such as Church of God with Signs in Appalachia have chosen to take as their core lines like Acts 28:1-6 and Mark 16:17-18 (\\"And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\\"). Others in the Pentecostal\\/Holiness movements emphasize more only the casting out devils, speaking in new tongues, and laying hands on the sick without the handling serpents or ingesting poison. Interestingly, as literal as these groups take those lines, they don\'t always take other lines quite as literally, and for instance most of these groups that I know about allow divorce and remarriage despite pretty clear New Testament arguments against it (\\"To the married I give this command [not I, but the Lord]: A wife must not separate from her husband. But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.\\" 1 Corinthians 7:10-11, \\"For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him. So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man,\\" Roman 7:2-3, \\"He answered, \'Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.  And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.\' Mark 10:11-12, etc. the best Christian justification of divorce is also here, as Jesus acknowledges that *Mosaic* law allows for divorce because of the \\"hardness of [the Pharisee\'s] hearts\\", even as he\'s clearly arguing against that, cf. Matthew 5:31-32). All groups at the very least must choose which parts of the Biblical corpus to emphasize.","edited":1488762538,"author_flair_css_class":"religion","is_submitter":false,"downs":0,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP, this gives information about sectarian groups that, in general, try to live a life apart from society, at times explicitly &amp;quot;in the world, but not of it&amp;quot;.

On these groups&amp;#39; webpages,&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The upper left hand is usually reserved for a donation screen, but then the rest of the left hand menu almost invariably lists the links to such topics as Abortion, Guns, School Prayer, Homosexuality, Persecution, etc. &lt;em&gt;The Bible is usually not one of them&lt;\\/em&gt;. It is deliberately submerged; one need not be a poststructuralist to recognize a sub-text, a hypo-text of the hyper-text. [...]On average it takes two or three and sometimes more links even to find a page that mentions the Bible or a biblical verse. &lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She continues (and remember, a lot of her essay is on the topic of Biblical literalism):&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\\u201cThe Christian world-view,\\u201d which is being promoted by a whole range of home-schooling and other cottage industries, is a code-phrase for \\u201cChristianity in our likeness.\\u201d Here from a link on the Dobson web site: \\u201cWhat is a biblical worldview? A biblical worldview is based on the infallible Word of God. When you believe the Bible is entirely true, then you allow it to be the foundation of everything you say and do. That means, for instance, you take seriously the mandate in Romans 13 to honor the governing authorities by researching the candidates and issues, making voting a priority.\\u201d Why is Romans 13 rather than the Beatitudes to be the center of the Christian solar system? As I shall argue below, along with a polemical intent similar to what we see in ancient commentators, &lt;em&gt;what most characterizes the Christian Right\\u2019s biblical interpretation is no single method, but rather its selection of passages and topics.&lt;\\/em&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For me, her discussion of the websites&amp;#39; condemnation of gambling is most interesting because the Bible doesn&amp;#39;t really have very much to say about gambling. As for the selective, single-minded, and  indeed misleading readings of other topics, Mitchell doesn&amp;#39;t mince words:&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;While it is easy to think of this as a literalistic proof-texting, it is not just that, but a highly creative rearrangement of selective pieces of the biblical record to justify a previously reached conclusion (in this case, apparently, the invasion of Iraq). Sometimes Land does include passages that might complicate the picture, but his own interpretive comments draw attention away from them. For example, we read \\u201cRom. 12:2 our ways are separate from the world\\u2019s ways,\\u201d but would hardly realize that under the listing Rom. 12:17-21 lies a text that contains both the actual word peace (Rom. 12:2 does not) and a command related to it: \\u201cif it is possible by your agency, live in peace with all people\\u201d (Rom. 12:18). It bears noting, in relation to my larger thesis, that it is Christian peace-makers of various stripes\\u2014not the Christian Right\\u2014who are the literalists when it comes to the latter verse.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;#39;t think Mitchell&amp;#39;s point is that those on the Christian Right don&amp;#39;t read their Bibles at all but rather, 1) people on all sides are much too quick to grant them their claimed title of Biblical literalists, 2) they engage in a variety of hermeneutic strategies, not merely literal interpretation of the plain text, 3) at least some of their judgements and analyses are driven by current conservative societal and political norms, rather than emulation of Biblical example. &lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;My thesis is that what makes the Christian Right biblical is not a literalistic hermeneutic so much as a mode of argumentation by reference to a deliberately selective set of biblical passages, annexed to the predetermined cause through a variety of exegetical moves, which are usually unexplained because they depend upon prior agreement of the ends of interpretation. And I have shown examples where there is a lot less biblical study going on than one might expect. The Christian Right represents biblical interpretation in a conjunction of two selective circles: of what are the key issues in the political realm and what are the central passages in the biblical record. It represents an odd alignment of each. The canonical delineation is striking\\u2014a focus on the Old Testament, with special prominence given to Judges and 1 and 2 Chronicles, as well as to Genesis and Leviticus; and in the New Testament, to selected moralizing passages of the Pauline letters and Revelation. It is easy to see then what is missing: the prophets of Israel and the teachings of Jesus (the Gospels). Along with them go concern with social\\/political issues such as economic inequality, peace-making, love and forgiveness, and critique of religious hypocrisy (just to choose a few!).&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/blockquote&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This, of course, only represents one part of contemporary Protestant Christianity (albeit likely the part most associated with the two issue you mention above). There are certainly other Christian groups--smaller and less publicly oriented--which, like &lt;a href=\\"\\/u\\/randomiblis\\"&gt;\\/u\\/randomiblis&lt;\\/a&gt; says, emphasize a very different set of Biblical passages: Anabaptists, Hutterites, Quakers, for instance, seem to emphasize the Gospels and Acts much more strongly than the American Christian Right (the Hutterites, for instance, practice a &amp;quot;community of goods&amp;quot; and own almost no private property, in direct emulation of Acts 2:44-47, 4:32-35, and the other groups form the core of the &lt;a href=\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Peace_churches\\"&gt;historic Peace Churches&lt;\\/a&gt; who found in the Gospels commendents for complete pacificism).  Preachers coming out of the politically engaged Black Protestant tradition, on the other hand, are much more likely to echo the calls for justice and fairness found in the Prophets than either the sectarian Christians or the Religious Right (&amp;quot;But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!&amp;quot; Amos 4:24). I once went to a Syriac Easter service in Midyat, Turkey where all the women dutifully covered their heads with gauzy, ethereal veils in accordance with pretty clear instructions of 1 Corinthians 11:4-6 (as soon as they stepped out of the church, they uncovered their heads so as not to be confused with local Arab and Kurdish Muslims).  &lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Certain &amp;quot;snake handling&amp;quot; Holiness sects in Appalachia such as Church of God with Signs in Appalachia have chosen to take as their core lines like Acts 28:1-6 and Mark 16:17-18 (&amp;quot;And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.&amp;quot;). Others in the Pentecostal\\/Holiness movements emphasize more only the casting out devils, speaking in new tongues, and laying hands on the sick without the handling serpents or ingesting poison. Interestingly, as literal as these groups take those lines, they don&amp;#39;t always take other lines quite as literally, and for instance most of these groups that I know about allow divorce and remarriage despite pretty clear New Testament arguments against it (&amp;quot;To the married I give this command [not I, but the Lord]: A wife must not separate from her husband. But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.&amp;quot; 1 Corinthians 7:10-11, &amp;quot;For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him. So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man,&amp;quot; Roman 7:2-3, &amp;quot;He answered, &amp;#39;Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.  And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.&amp;#39; Mark 10:11-12, etc. the best Christian justification of divorce is also here, as Jesus acknowledges that &lt;em&gt;Mosaic&lt;\\/em&gt; law allows for divorce because of the &amp;quot;hardness of [the Pharisee&amp;#39;s] hearts&amp;quot;, even as he&amp;#39;s clearly arguing against that, cf. Matthew 5:31-32). All groups at the very least must choose which parts of the Biblical corpus to emphasize.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n&lt;\\/div&gt;","stickied":false,"subreddit_type":"public","can_gild":true,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"author_flair_text_color":"dark","score_hidden":false,"permalink":"\\/r\\/AskHistorians\\/comments\\/5xnfiq\\/why_are_prohibitions_against_gay_marriage_and\\/dejzlrc\\/","num_reports":null,"name":"t1_dejzlrc","created":1488788561,"subreddit":"AskHistorians","author_flair_text":"Comparative Religion","collapsed":false,"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\\/AskHistorians","ups":179,"depth":2,"author_flair_background_color":"","mod_reports":[],"mod_note":null,"distinguished":null}}],"after":null,"before":null}},"user_reports":[],"saved":false,"id":"dejvqoc","banned_at_utc":null,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"archived":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"wizzo89","can_mod_post":false,"created_utc":1488754263,"send_replies":true,"parent_id":"t1_dejqcty","score":58,"author_fullname":"t2_8bobi","approved_by":null,"controversiality":0,"body":"I\'m American but your answer was still very interesting nonetheless.

I know, I know, reddit gloms onto anything that smells of religion and hypocrisy. But bear with me, because the intellectual and political developments in play are important to *understanding*, beyond any gut jerk condemnation or automatic acceptance.

The story that Christians tell themselves, passed down in the Book of Acts and some of the New Testament epistles, is that Jesus came and fulfilled the Law, that is, the Old Testament. It\'s pretty clear in context that the critical issue was nascent Christianity\'s built in mission (evangelization) imperative juxtaposed with Jewish prescriptions, most importantly circumcision, although kosher laws also feature prominently in the biblical discussion.

But while what is depicted by Christian tradition as a battle between "Jewish Christians" and "Gentile Christians" ultimately comes down on the side of God apparently no longer requiring circumcision in the "new covenant," this hardly means that developing Christianity shed its Jewish roots including the Old Testament, or the Hellenized Roman culture in which it incubated. Everyone\'s favorite example here is abortion, so let\'s roll with it. Early and medieval Christians recognized abortion as a moral question, connected to infanticide. But perspectives differed-and would continue to differ-on when abortion began to be a problem. Was it always immoral? Or was it only immoral after the infusion of the soul into the body? And when was that, and was it different for boys and girls? As John Riddle points out, even as one tradition that would become canon law condemned contraception and abortion, some theologians continued to repeat earlier ideas and even mention recipes for contraceptives.

The complicating and complicated, but crucial, factor is sex. Christianity inherits a deep skepticism towards sex and the human body from Greek philosophy, to the extent that Jerome (who gave us the Vulgate Bible) argues that virgins should kill themselves to avoid the pollution of *being raped*. Of course, a society without sex is self-eradicating, and Christians quickly come up with the longstanding view that sex is okay if it is in accord with nature, that is, can lead to procreation. And the wonderfully spicy Song of Songs is reinscribed as an allegory: the love song between Christ and his Church or Christ and the soul (or, because he Middle Ages love you and want you to be happy, Christ and Mary, his virgin mother).

The spread and entrenchment of thhe Latin Church as a landed power over the early high Middle Ages introduced a new wrinkle to the concept of moral authority: legal authority, and the desire to shepherd and augment it for the salvation of as many people as possible. Christians have a harder task in the establishment of religious law than Jews and Muslims, since the NT works mightily hard to reject legalism as a principle. So canon (Church) law ends up cobbled together out of the Bible, philosophers, practical situations.  It\'s in the efforts to codify canon law in 11-12C that theolgians start to pay attention to sodomy with a definition of (male, primarily) homosexuality. Although it is still just one form of the "sin against nature", and there are no signs of active persecution from Latin Christians. But the codification of canon law reflects a long term trend in the west towards social order, hierarchy, purity, playing out above all on religious (anti-Semitism) and gender policing lines (misogyny, patriarchal families, strict gender roles and gender expression norms). Homosexual sex acts stack up poorly here, as you can imagine, and by the fifteenth century it can be and sometimes was punishable by death.

So what is the Bible doing in all this? As suggested by the multivalent interpretations of the Song of Songs (totally ripped from rabbinic readings of the love been God and his chosen people, by the way), medieval biblical interpretation was majestically flexible. This could lead to things like understanding the story of Jonah as a prophecy of Christ, descending into hell for three days, as well as being the story of a man who tried to say no to God and got eaten by a fish. Or it       could mean trying to apply the "sons of Noah"-Shem, Japheth, Ham-as a paradigm to understand the peoples of an expanding (in Latin consciousness) world. The most famous medieval permutation here is the use of the curse of Ham to justify the existence of Latin, Christian serfdom. It often took on geographic origin meanings, however, which were as varied as the peoples of the Mediterranean world. In the early modern era, the western interpretation will harden into the "curse of Ham" that morally justifies the enslavement of black Africans by white Europeans and colonial descendants.

But that development, and even more its entrenchment, are somewhat of a departure in the evolution of European intellectual culture. Even as the Protestant reformers and the Catholic reaction supposedly streamline and "harden" biblical interpretation methods (don\'t worry, the Song of Songs lives on in all its meanings), first the influence of humanism and then the evolution of natural philosophy into science never quite allowed the Bible to be Clarissa Explains It All.

Well, nineteenth century coming at you to change all that.

An important evolution that is actually played out in interpretations of the curse of Ham story is a growing sense that slavery is a moral issue. Not just related to religious in-group-ism, but ownership of humans in light of humanity, period. Now, it\'s crucial to recognize the mutually reinforcing and guiding nature of religious beliefs/morality and other circumstances, be they political, economic, environmental, what have you. Mark Noll\'s *The Civil War as a Theological Crisis* (which is to some extent the point towards which so much of career oriented him) lays out cleanly that the split between Christians opposed to slavery and Christians supporting it broke down along the geographic lines you would expect, but also that both sides made religion the basis for securing popular support. Abolitionists appealed to the ideals of "liberal theology" (not in the modern US political sense) and biblical exegesis, favoring holistic readings and the "sense" of scripture. Slavery\'s defenders huddled down into what we call proof-texting: if you can find it in the Bible, somehow someway, it\'s God\'s inerrant word. Even if there are contradictory texts. This principle-fundamentalism, literalism, inerrancy-is a 19C invention. But so is the abolitionists\' holistic reading. So is Luther\'s the Old Testament through the cross hermeneutic. So is medieval and patristic fourfold senses (historical and three allegorical forms).

All of these developments that I\'ve talked about-sex, literalism, holistic/critical exegesis, race, moral politics, the role of religion in galvanizing political opinion and vice versa, tumble into the 20C. If anything, the Victorian and then Progressive era and its emphasis on "middle class values" (an adjusted vision of rightly ordered, moral society) demonstrated even more firmly the power of religion in spurring people\'s political activism as well as introducing new dimensions of concern over the policing of sex and, now, "sexuality." This period also saw a critical social invention in America: widespread, mandatory public education.

This was inseparable from religion, please understand. Apart from the Catholic Church\'s long leadership role in all levels of education and nuns as THE champions of educating girls, late 19/early 29C Catholics often perceived public schools as a covert Protestant indoctrination, hence the longstanding tradition of Catholic schools in many American cities. This is a vital precedent. Because when the US finally gets its head temporarily out of the racist sand and makes school segregation illegal, it\'s southern Christians in the same "biblical inerrancy" tradition who defended slavery, who lack qualms about expressing their racism.

I choose my word carefully here. Because you can certainly cherry pick quotes from the odd Protestant leader or Southern politician who explicitly links the rise of religious (Protestant, PLEASE) schools, mainly in the south, to a desire to prolong segregation. That\'s not the dominant narrative, you understand. Religious freedom! Need to secure the morality of our good sons and daughters! Gosh, and don\'t those race based admissions requirements make it a safer environment for the children. When the segregation policies were challenged in court (Green v. Connally; Coit v. Green), it was easy to sell this as religious persecution, not the government\'s rightful enforcement of due civil rights. And to be clear: the issue here wasn\'t about the closure of the schools. What got conservative Christians crying persecution! was the threat of revoking the schools\' tax-exempt status. America, y\'all.

The lesson, going forwards, would be the power of evangelical Protestant Christianity as a political force-to motivate its believers, and the vitality of the consenting-to-legal-racism white voter as a target bloc.',
'body_html' => '&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1/2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, reddit gloms onto anything that smells of religion and hypocrisy. But bear with me, because the intellectual and political developments in play are important to &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt;, beyond any gut jerk condemnation or automatic acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story that Christians tell themselves, passed down in the Book of Acts and some of the New Testament epistles, is that Jesus came and fulfilled the Law, that is, the Old Testament. It&amp;#39;s pretty clear in context that the critical issue was nascent Christianity&amp;#39;s built in mission (evangelization) imperative juxtaposed with Jewish prescriptions, most importantly circumcision, although kosher laws also feature prominently in the biblical discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while what is depicted by Christian tradition as a battle between &amp;quot;Jewish Christians&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Gentile Christians&amp;quot; ultimately comes down on the side of God apparently no longer requiring circumcision in the &amp;quot;new covenant,&amp;quot; this hardly means that developing Christianity shed its Jewish roots including the Old Testament, or the Hellenized Roman culture in which it incubated. Everyone&amp;#39;s favorite example here is abortion, so let&amp;#39;s roll with it. Early and medieval Christians recognized abortion as a moral question, connected to infanticide. But perspectives differed-and would continue to differ-on when abortion began to be a problem. Was it always immoral? Or was it only immoral after the infusion of the soul into the body? And when was that, and was it different for boys and girls? As John Riddle points out, even as one tradition that would become canon law condemned contraception and abortion, some theologians continued to repeat earlier ideas and even mention recipes for contraceptives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complicating and complicated, but crucial, factor is sex. Christianity inherits a deep skepticism towards sex and the human body from Greek philosophy, to the extent that Jerome (who gave us the Vulgate Bible) argues that virgins should kill themselves to avoid the pollution of &lt;em&gt;being raped&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, a society without sex is self-eradicating, and Christians quickly come up with the longstanding view that sex is okay if it is in accord with nature, that is, can lead to procreation. And the wonderfully spicy Song of Songs is reinscribed as an allegory: the love song between Christ and his Church or Christ and the soul (or, because he Middle Ages love you and want you to be happy, Christ and Mary, his virgin mother).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spread and entrenchment of thhe Latin Church as a landed power over the early high Middle Ages introduced a new wrinkle to the concept of moral authority: legal authority, and the desire to shepherd and augment it for the salvation of as many people as possible. Christians have a harder task in the establishment of religious law than Jews and Muslims, since the NT works mightily hard to reject legalism as a principle. So canon (Church) law ends up cobbled together out of the Bible, philosophers, practical situations.  It&amp;#39;s in the efforts to codify canon law in 11-12C that theolgians start to pay attention to sodomy with a definition of (male, primarily) homosexuality. Although it is still just one form of the &amp;quot;sin against nature&amp;quot;, and there are no signs of active persecution from Latin Christians. But the codification of canon law reflects a long term trend in the west towards social order, hierarchy, purity, playing out above all on religious (anti-Semitism) and gender policing lines (misogyny, patriarchal families, strict gender roles and gender expression norms). Homosexual sex acts stack up poorly here, as you can imagine, and by the fifteenth century it can be and sometimes was punishable by death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the Bible doing in all this? As suggested by the multivalent interpretations of the Song of Songs (totally ripped from rabbinic readings of the love been God and his chosen people, by the way), medieval biblical interpretation was majestically flexible. This could lead to things like understanding the story of Jonah as a prophecy of Christ, descending into hell for three days, as well as being the story of a man who tried to say no to God and got eaten by a fish. Or it       could mean trying to apply the &amp;quot;sons of Noah&amp;quot;-Shem, Japheth, Ham-as a paradigm to understand the peoples of an expanding (in Latin consciousness) world. The most famous medieval permutation here is the use of the curse of Ham to justify the existence of Latin, Christian serfdom. It often took on geographic origin meanings, however, which were as varied as the peoples of the Mediterranean world. In the early modern era, the western interpretation will harden into the &amp;quot;curse of Ham&amp;quot; that morally justifies the enslavement of black Africans by white Europeans and colonial descendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that development, and even more its entrenchment, are somewhat of a departure in the evolution of European intellectual culture. Even as the Protestant reformers and the Catholic reaction supposedly streamline and &amp;quot;harden&amp;quot; biblical interpretation methods (don&amp;#39;t worry, the Song of Songs lives on in all its meanings), first the influence of humanism and then the evolution of natural philosophy into science never quite allowed the Bible to be Clarissa Explains It All.&lt;/p&gt;

The debt of Christian asceticism to the Stoics and neo-Platonists is well acknowledged alongside the influence of Jewish penitential penitential practices (and, in turn, their relationship with hellenistic philosophies).

That\'s a really, really broad question. Instead, I\'m just going to talk about abortion as viewed by Evangelical Christianity in the United States. This issue has not always been a priority, and much of the focus on and politicization of it started in the 1980s. My comment is based on chapter 2 of _Broken Words: The Abuse of Science and Faith in American Politics_ by Jonathan Dudley (which is impeccably sourced; nearly a quarter of the book is citations). See [this summary of the relevant chapter](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2012/02/18/the-biblical-view-thats-younger-than-the-happy-meal/) for more. 

The bible itself is very wishy-washy on abortion: it\'s not explicitly mentioned in the New Testament, and the Old Testament is pretty permissive of it (hence why it\'s not uncommon for Jews to be pro-choice). If someone injures a pregnant woman and kills her, it\'s a crime punishable by death, but if the injury merely causes her to miscarry, the offender shall just pay a fine (Exodus 21; I\'m quoting chapter but not verse so that you have to look at the surrounding verses before claiming I\'m taking anything out of context). God commanded Moses to take a census but no one under 1 month old counted as a person (Numbers 3). Numbers 5 contains instructions on how to make a potion that is harmless when drunk by faithful women but causes miscarriages when drunk by adulterers. There are other verses, but those three hit home for me.

Early Christians had varied and conflicting views on when ensoulment took place and when abortion counted as murder. Tertullian and Calvin would today be considered pro-life, while Augustine and Aquinas would be considered pro-choice. The Catholic church became strictly anti-abortion in the 1800s, though I don\'t have a good understanding of why that happened. In contrast, Protestants were largely pro-choice. This continued for over a century, as the Catholics started passing anti-abortion statutes in various states. 

Evangelicals were somewhere between ambivalent and opposed to banning abortion. In 1968, _Christianity Today_ magazine and the Christian Medical Society wrote [A Protestant Affirmation on the Control of Human Reproduction,](http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1970/JASA6-70Christian.html) which states that "when principles conflict, the preservation of fetal life... may have to be abandoned in order to maintain full and secure family life." The Southern Baptist Convention of 1971 resolved to "work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the **emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.**" They reiterated this position in 1974 and 1976 (note that _Roe v. Wade_ was in 1973). 

As for how this flipped, Francis Schaeffer, Jerry Falwell, Ed Dobson, and other folks like that were trying to turn Evangelicals into a political force, reasoning that there are a whole lot of Evangelicals and they\'d be able to have a massive influence if they just got everyone organized and pointing in the same direction. This started with a wide variety of issues: segregation, the Equal Rights Amendment, feminism, etc. They found that by coming down squarely on the anti-abortion side, they could increase their influence on Catholics, and draw in a larger crowd of people. By the 1980s, they had a sense of which issues drew people in, and discarded all the other issues that didn\'t have the same effect (so, abortion stayed on their agenda, while mandatory school prayer was dropped). They then went full force on these issues, which convinced a receptive audience that these were biblical stances, and the religious right grew in strength and influence. ',

Instead, I’ll focus my efforts mainly on the history of the alignment between the Republican party and conservative Christianity. It’s easy to see that today conservative Republican ideology and Christian ideology go hand-in-hand. But your question is specifically about the *history* of this issue, and you ask if its always been that way. The answer appears to be yes, for at least the last 50 years.

A 2015 Gallup poll found that 40% of those polled would not vote for a candidate who was an atheist, and 24% would not vote for a gay/lesbian candidate. Below is their exact wording of the question:
&gt; Between now and the 2016 election, there will be discussion about the qualifications of presidential candidates - their education, age, religion, race, and so on. If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happened to be (fill-in-the-blank), would you vote for that person? (McCarthy, 2015)

In general, Gallup polls is a wonderful resource for determining how political attitudes in the US have changed over time, because they ask the same questions (although sometimes the wording changes slightly) year after year. With specific reference to this question, it has been asked of people since 1937, although at that time the only identities asked about were female, Jewish, or Catholic. The earliest data Gallup offers about gay/lesbian candidates is from 1978, when just 26% of respondents said they would vote for such a candidate, compared to 68% in 2012. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Republicans are less likely to vote for a gay/lesbian candidate than either Democrats or Independents. In 2016, 85% of Democrats said they would vote for a gay/lesbian candidate, compared to 61% of Republicans (McCarthy, 2015; Jones, 2012).

The data from Gallup suggests that Republicans’ fixation with homosexuality dates back to at least the late 1970s. Other sources provide different avenues of information and trace the origins of the alignment of Republicans and conservative Christians back even further. In 1968, Pope Paul VI issued the encyclical *Humanae Vitae*, establishing the position of the Catholic Church as anti-abortion and anti-contraceptive:
&gt;We are obliged once more to declare that the direct interruption of the generative process already begun and, above all, all direct abortion, even for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as lawful means of regulating the number of children^(14). Equally to be condemned, as the magisterium of the Church has affirmed on many occasions, is direct sterilization, whether of the man or of the woman, whether permanent or temporary^(15) (Paul VI, 1969).

The reference footnotes in the above quote are:
&gt; ^(14) See Council of Trent Roman Catechism, Part II, ch. 8; Pius XI, encyclical letter Casti connubii: AAS 22 (1930), 562-564; Pius XII, Address to Medico-Biological Union of St. Luke: Discorsi e radiomessaggi, VI, 191-192; Address to Midwives: AAS 43 (1951), 842-843; Address to Family Campaign and other family
associations: AAS 43 (1951), 857-859; John XXIII, encyclical letter Pacem in Terris: AAS 55 (1963), 259-260 [TPS IX, 15-16]; Second Vatican Council, Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the World of Today, no. 51: AAS 58 (1966), 1072 [TPS XI, 293].

&gt; ^(15) See Pius XI, encyclical letter Casti connubii: AAS 22 (1930), 565; Decree of the Holy Office, Feb. 22, 1940: AAS 32 (1940), 73; Pius XII, Address to Midwives: AAS 43 (1951), 843-844; to the Society of Hematology: AAS 50 (1958), 734-735 [TPS VI, 394-395].

Because of this addition to the Catholic dogma, many Catholics felt compelled to adjust their voting habits accordingly. In the late 1960s, the Republican party had already established itself as having anti-abortion leanings, so the alignment came quite naturally. A 1980 study looking at abortion trends found that roughly 41% of respondents supported abortion. Respondents were given six reasons and asked if they would support a woman getting an abortion due to that reason. In 1977, a seventh item was added, asking if respondents would support a woman getting an abortion “for any reason.” The reason with the most support was “If the woman\'s health is seriously endangered” with 73 percent, and the reason with the least support was “If the woman is married and does not want any more children” with 16 percent (Granberg and Granberg, 1980; Guttmatcher Institute, 1983).

In addition to the Papal element, the Republicans had also set themselves up to favor the white vote, particularly the racist whites who opposed the Civil Rights Act and racial integration. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, and a pervasive legend has him as saying some variant of “There goes the South for a generation,” or “We [Democrats] have lost the South for a generation” (Green, 2014). However, Dr. Steven J. Allen (2014) cites a wide body of research, all of which finds no evidence of Johnson having ever said that. But regardless of if Johnson said those words, there appears to have been an element of truth behind them. Kevin Phillips, an aide to Richard Nixon, is quoted as saying:
&gt;All the talk about Republicans making inroads into the Negro vote is persiflage […] From now on, the Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don’t need any more than that. […] The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. That’s where the votes are (Boyd, 1970).

Returning to the aforementioned Gallup polls which asked if people would vote for a candidate of a specific identity, they found that support was low for black candidates in the 1950s and 1960s. Support reached a majority level for the first time in 1965 with 59%. It’s worth noting that, prior to 1978, the question asked about “a negro” man rather than “a black” person, although the trend of gradually increasing support for black candidates was evident from 1958 on (Jones, 2012). The Washington post compiled data showing that, in 1940, black Americans were about equally likely to vote Democrat as Republican, but they’ve since skewed heavily Democrat beginning in 1948. The article cites Jay Cost of Real Clear Politics as crediting the huge spike to Harry Truman’s policies, including “a federal ban on lynching and bolstering existing civil rights laws” (Bump, 2015).

This skewing of Black voters away from the Republican party also fit well with the existing trends of many white evangelicals as being opposed to racial integration. There’s some debate as to the degree to which this opposition was motivated by out-and-out racism, but the level of support is fairly clear (Taylor, 2016). Because many conservative Christians were opposed to racial segregation, and the Republican party had publicly espoused similar ideals, it only made sense that they’d align.

**TL;DR**: In the 1960s, conservative Christians were opposed to abortion, birth control, and racial integration, as was the Republican party. Alignment of their causes naturally followed.

In 2016, 85% of Democrats said they would vote for a gay/lesbian candidate, compared to 61% of Republicans (McCarthy, 2015; Jones, 2012).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data from Gallup suggests that Republicans’ fixation with homosexuality dates back to at least the late 1970s. Other sources provide different avenues of information and trace the origins of the alignment of Republicans and conservative Christians back even further. In 1968, Pope Paul VI issued the encyclical &lt;em&gt;Humanae Vitae&lt;/em&gt;, establishing the position of the Catholic Church as anti-abortion and anti-contraceptive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are obliged once more to declare that the direct interruption of the generative process already begun and, above all, all direct abortion, even for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as lawful means of regulating the number of children&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;. Equally to be condemned, as the magisterium of the Church has affirmed on many occasions, is direct sterilization, whether of the man or of the woman, whether permanent or temporary&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; (Paul VI, 1969).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reference footnotes in the above quote are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; See Pius XI, encyclical letter Casti connubii: AAS 22 (1930), 565; Decree of the Holy Office, Feb. 22, 1940: AAS 32 (1940), 73; Pius XII, Address to Midwives: AAS 43 (1951), 843-844; to the Society of Hematology: AAS 50 (1958), 734-735 [TPS VI, 394-395].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this addition to the Catholic dogma, many Catholics felt compelled to adjust their voting habits accordingly. In the late 1960s, the Republican party had already established itself as having anti-abortion leanings, so the alignment came quite naturally. A 1980 study looking at abortion trends found that roughly 41% of respondents supported abortion. Respondents were given six reasons and asked if they would support a woman getting an abortion due to that reason. In 1977, a seventh item was added, asking if respondents would support a woman getting an abortion “for any reason.” The reason with the most support was “If the woman&amp;#39;s health is seriously endangered” with 73 percent, and the reason with the least support was “If the woman is married and does not want any more children” with 16 percent (Granberg and Granberg, 1980; Guttmatcher Institute, 1983).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Papal element, the Republicans had also set themselves up to favor the white vote, particularly the racist whites who opposed the Civil Rights Act and racial integration. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, and a pervasive legend has him as saying some variant of “There goes the South for a generation,” or “We [Democrats] have lost the South for a generation” (Green, 2014). However, Dr. Steven J. Allen (2014) cites a wide body of research, all of which finds no evidence of Johnson having ever said that. But regardless of if Johnson said those words, there appears to have been an element of truth behind them. Kevin Phillips, an aide to Richard Nixon, is quoted as saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the talk about Republicans making inroads into the Negro vote is persiflage […] From now on, the Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don’t need any more than that. […] The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. That’s where the votes are (Boyd, 1970).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the aforementioned Gallup polls which asked if people would vote for a candidate of a specific identity, they found that support was low for black candidates in the 1950s and 1960s. Support reached a majority level for the first time in 1965 with 59%. It’s worth noting that, prior to 1978, the question asked about “a negro” man rather than “a black” person, although the trend of gradually increasing support for black candidates was evident from 1958 on (Jones, 2012). The Washington post compiled data showing that, in 1940, black Americans were about equally likely to vote Democrat as Republican, but they’ve since skewed heavily Democrat beginning in 1948. The article cites Jay Cost of Real Clear Politics as crediting the huge spike to Harry Truman’s policies, including “a federal ban on lynching and bolstering existing civil rights laws” (Bump, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This skewing of Black voters away from the Republican party also fit well with the existing trends of many white evangelicals as being opposed to racial integration. There’s some debate as to the degree to which this opposition was motivated by out-and-out racism, but the level of support is fairly clear (Taylor, 2016). Because many conservative Christians were opposed to racial segregation, and the Republican party had publicly espoused similar ideals, it only made sense that they’d align.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: In the 1960s, conservative Christians were opposed to abortion, birth control, and racial integration, as was the Republican party. Alignment of their causes naturally followed.&lt;/p&gt;

Livingston (the R. also stood for Robert, oddly enough) were sent to Paris not to buy the enormous swath of land subsequently called the Louisiana Purchase but to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta, thereby securing the lucrative Mississippi River shipping route. Negotiations fell through, and it wasn\'t until Livingston returned in 1803 that Napoleon was so hard-up on cash due to the continent-wide war of conquest he was waging that he was willing to make a deal with the Americans. At the time, Livingston was authorized by Jefferson to spend up to $9 million in order to purchase New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi. Since the US was planning on making a significant purchase from France, the delegation (Monroe rejoined Livingston in Paris shortly thereafter) travelled to Paris with $3 million in gold. In 1803,[gold was worth just under $20 an ounce](http://onlygold.com/Info/Historical-Gold-Prices.asp), which means they were travelling with almost 10,000 lbs of gold. This wasn\'t even remotely close to the carrying capacity of freighters of the time. ["Tea Clipper" Frigates of that time could carry twenty times that weight.](http://www.tea.co.uk/tea-clippers).

Now, the negotiations took a turn when Napoleon decided he needed more money and offered the whole Louisiana Purchase for $15 million. Livingston and Monroe were authorized by Jefferson to spend up to 9 million on New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi, so when given this offer, they had to make a decision without the President\'s approval, and just couldn\'t pass up the deal. Oddly enough, I just read the chapter describing the negotiations in Stephen Clarke\'s very entertaining *1000 Years of Annoying the French*.  According to Clarke, the purchase was paid for with the above-mentioned 3 million in gold as a down payment, with the cancelling of 3.75 million in debt that France owed to the US for French piracy on American ships since the revolution, and the rest was issued in bonds. Again from Clarke:

&gt;French Banks were too nervous to accept the bonds, and two foreign banks had to step in to provide the cash. The first was Hope and Company,  a bank based in Amsterdam but set up by Scotsmen. The second was a London bank, Barings. Napoleon was in such dire straits that he agreed to sell the bonds to the banks at a 12.5% discount. 

I hope this answers your question sufficiently!

So, OP. I\'m quite sure you won\'t believe me, but if you invade Russia, *you will have a bad time*. Don\'t believe me? Well, if you try to grab that bear by the nose ring, you\'re going to have to face the following:

* Your baggage train is going to be *long*. You think you know a thing or two about baggage trains? You know squat once you try to stretch one to there and back, and I started off a lot closer than you did. You should be happy if you even have it when you get there, which you won\'t. 
* That said, since you\'ll be living without a supply chain, you\'ll be living off the land. This will *not* make the general populace happy where you pass through, not to mention the raping and killing that your horde will commit on the march. That walk home is going to be a lot longer when you have gangs of roving partisans picking your army to pieces. 
* *"Oh, but I won\'t need a long baggage train, I\'ll win a decisive battle!"* I hear you say? No, you won\'t, that\'s not how the Russians roll. They\'ll fight you when they\'re good and ready. 
* Do you even have an escape plan? I was lucky and had a buddy down south I could hide out with for a few years when everything went pear shaped. 
* Not sure from your post if you\'re planning on hiring any Cossacks. My tip: don\'t. Using Cossacks always ends badly. Cossacks suck. 

So to summarize, I know you\'ve just spanked a ton of Germans, you\'ve routed the Russians a bit, you have the finest infantry there ever was, your army fancies you a minor deity, and you\'re feeling like the king of the world. I know, because I\'ve been there, done that, ate the Semla. Literally all of it. I can see the road you\'re headed down though, and unless you change course, reality is going to hit you like a bullet to the side of the head. ',

But when the topic of invading their land is raised, there is reference only to the attempts of peoples like the Swedes and the Germans. These were not the first to try their hand at it. Many centuries earlier, Cyrus, Great King, King of Babylon, King of the Four Corners of the Earth, King of the Universe, also invaded the land of the Scythians, but he came to a bad end, and his expedition floundered. Then a few generations later, my lord and uncle, Darius, invaded again, marching through Thrace and across the Danube with all the peoples over which he ruled. But the Scythians - uncivilised liars all - refused to engage him in battle. They left their land desolate and retreated, again and again, until my lord Darius\' supplies were depleted, and he was forced to withdraw.^1 Many were killed in the retreat, preyed upon by the mounted archers of the enemy. While Darius obviously conquered the place, since no one resisted him, it was a bit harder to enforce the demands of the Great King once the army had left their lands. This was a blemish on the otherwise glorious career of Darius, conqueror of Thrace and Naxos and Euboea and vanquisher of the rebellious cities of the Yauna that dwell by the sea.

'body' => 'No, in medieval Europe,  there were no restrictions on common soldiers killing a king or any other aristocrats. If soldiers were able to identify a particularly important individual, there would probably have been a mad scramble to capture him rather than kill him outright, both for political purposes and for the potential for ransom profits. This happened to the French king Jean II at Poitiers, who was taken prisoner in a furious melee where other high-ranking French aristocrats, who ordinarily would have made excellent ransoms, were killed (possibly by accident as English troops swarmed to grab Jean specifically). When kings were killed outright in combat, it does not seem to have been a particular mark of controversy. John the Blind, King of Bohemia, died at Crecy but his killer was not specifically identified in accounts of the battle and the story of his death is conveyed merely as an illustration of John\'s bravery and valiant nature. Kings who fought did so in the full knowledge that they were at risk of being killed or captured at the battlefield.

English military contracts from the Hundred Years War suggest that there was no stigma attached to a common soldier capturing important aristocrats; they often contained clauses saying that any particular important prisoners (like a prince or something) would be handed over to the king in exchange for a cash payment. This worked to both parties\'  advantage: common soldiers would probably not be be financially able to house and feed a prisoner (especially a royal prisoner) during the period in which the ransom was negotiated and paid. If there was any limitation on killing aristocrats, it would be that troops wanted to maximize their profit by taking nobles alive for ransom. This is most apparent in the hesitation of some English troops to kill their prisoners at the Battle of Agincourt. This incident is often taken as some kind of commentary on class relations, but in reality is just a reflection of soldiers looking out for their bottom line. ',

Whilst I am not aware of any direct account of soldiers fighting over a ransom, we do have surviving documentary evidence that it was at least a potentially anticipated outcome of warfare and of the soldiers\' desire for self-enrichment. There are surviving copies of late medieval English army ordinances. These were disciplinary codes, like a rulebook, proclaimed (usually) by the king to proscribe how his soldiers and captains should behave on campaign, a list of regulations detailing how the men should march, forage, and perform watch and guard duty etc. From the earliest complete set we know of, Richard II\'s ordinances of 1385, multiple rules existed to clarify the rules of prisoner taking. Direct comparisons with this set can be made with subsequent sets issued by later English kings, all the way through to the reign of Henry VIII in the sixteenth century, so some 160 years or so.\\n\\nThe first rule of relevance, clause 8, amongst other points, states that \' no one shall make a riot or contention in the army for debate of arms or prisoners...\'. It\'s important to remember these rules were issued prior to the beginning of the campaign, and thus suggest they deal with issues that the commanders were trying to pre-empt before they could become a problem within the army. Evidently, they thought it was possible that soldiers could argue over prisoners.\\n\\nSecondly, another clause deals directly with the issue of a soldier threatening to kill a prisoner if he is not allowed to share in a part of the ransom. This was expressly forbidden, both in the 1385 ordinances of Richard II, and in the later ordinances issued sometime between 1419 and 1421 by Henry V, which state: \\n\\n*\'Also, if that eny man take a prisoner, and eny other man come uppon hym asking parte, manacyng ells that he wolle sle(slay) the said prisoner, he shall have no parte, though so be that parte hath ben graunted hym; and if he sle the prisoner, he shalbe arrested by the Mareshall and putte in warde(jail) without delyveraunce, til have made fyn(fine) aftyr the aware(award) of the Conestable\'.*\\n\\nIt\'s fairly easy to read if you say it out loud! If a soldier was found guilty of \'menacing to slay\' a prisoner, he was arrested by the army marshal (who was in charge of disicpline within the host) and kept captive. Again, this implies the high command anticipated a scenario where a soldier could attempt to force his way into receiving part of a lucrative ransom. What\'s fascinating about this rule to me is the lack of a \'chivalry\' aspect. There is no humanitarian concern evidenced in the wording of the clause, the punishment does not appear to be for the killing of a defenseless prisoner. Instead, the punishment is a monetary fine payable to the soldier who lost his prisoner, to compensate him for his lost money. To make amends the culprit must reimburse the aggreived soldier of how much ransom money he has lost as judged by the army constable. It is not until the army ordinances of Henry VIII, issued in 1513, that the killer would face capital punishment for slaying the prisoner, but it is not clear whether that is due to humanitarian concerns of killing a defenseless man, or simply a punishment for breaking rules and\\/or for potentially causing arguments within the ranks.\\n\\nRichard\'s ordinances of 1385 also explicitly state in a seperate rule that a soldier should take a gauntlet or bascinet(helmet) from their prisoners in order to be able to identify themselves as the captor. In yet another clause, the ordinances state that if an enemy is knocked down and incapacitated by one man, and then another soldier comes later and takes \'the faith or parole of the said enemy\', then the ransom should be split evenly between the two soldiers. Again, this strongly suggests that ownership of a prisoner was a potential hotbed for debate and the high command sought to streamline and codify the process as much as possible to prevent in-fighting. As MI13 said, this also implies a co-crediting for capture. Unfortunately, as they noted, although these rules imply this was an issue that needed to be solved, the exact battlefield mechanics remain shrouded by time. Perhaps the ordinances issued by the earl of Salisbury in the 1420s in Normandy add a bit more detail to the issue. They regard the regulations for assaulting a stronghold but they specify that the soldiers must be divided into groups, where some of them will remain with their standard\\/flag, whilst the rest of the group moves through the town \'to seek their booty\'. This means that units of soldiers would indeed co-operate in the gathering of winnings, and perhaps we can infer from this that a similar procedure was used in prisoner taking. When a captain and his soldiers took prisoners, some men would remain to guard them whilst the rest of the company continued the fight. The tight-knit nature of late medieval English indentured retinues would hopefully then ensure the men either evenly divided the fortune, or adhered to the ordinances and did not contest the ransom of a prisoner fairly captured by one of their comrades. If one of their comrades had only managed to remove the enemy from the fight, but a second soldier had to actually physically capture and bring him back to the standard then they would share the ransom as described by the rule mentioned above.

The benefits of their wealth and station were required to be defended at arms and due to feudal obligations join their liege in service; often with a prescribed amount of other people of lesser status and levies. Warfare was the domain of those with a degree of wealth and status, and was for millennia. Even during much of the Roman Republic, there were wealth requirements to fight. For a long time and in many Western societies, an armed and property-less populace was mistrusted and seen as out of place. A peasant with no wealth or status had few reasons to show up on a battlefield, aside from self-serving ones unless they were obligated\\/forced by a liege. In short, warfare was mostly to advance\\/protect one\'s stake in society so people with little\\/no stake in society weren\'t always involved.\\n\\nIt was actually well established and especially in the late medieval period where there is more documentation is it attested. There\'s an exhaustive list of situations where somebody could become a POW, especially for a knight or noble as their arms\\/armor and coat of arms indicates so. If their side lost the field, then they could easily be separated, injured, unhorsed, unable to withdraw, unable to rejoin their retinue, etc. Since nobility had the best armor, they were not always outright slain, perhaps just injured or stunned. Furthermore, as I mentioned prior, warfare was mostly the domain of those with some status, so quarter was expected and received as such was with chivalry. Nobles were fighting those with similarities, possibly even relations to themselves. There was an expected civility in warfare which made some aspects not as deadly as it would seem; which is why the exceptions are quite notable - such as Agincourt where many French nobles were KIA and King Henry V decided to execute French POWs mid-battle. On the contrary, for those of little status, warfare was deadlier (less training\\/equipment) and enemy combatants weren\'t going out of their way to necessarily capture them. \\n\\nSo the realities were a noble had a much higher chance of being captured and ransomed rather than outright slain. Furthermore, it was also expected that as a noble they would receive care and accommodations fitting of their station. Many combatants were worth more alive than dead, but obviously the risk-rewards of attempting to capture somebody unwilling to surrender became less appealing. Even a landless man-at-arms was likely to have some small material wealth to be paid for a ransom, even if it left him with nothing. On the contrary, commoner volunteers or levies could not rely on being captured (worth nothing) and being treated well (no status), outside of the kindness\\/chivalry (clemency in form of *caritas* and *humanitas*) of their enemies. It is worth noting that the Catholic church condemned the killing of any other surrendering Catholics no matter their station.\\n\\nSo supposing a noble is captured in battle, there was a system in place to secure their return. Initially, if the captors were of a lower class they\'d be passed upwards and could receive an immediate bounty or else would have to wait for their portion of the ransom. Nobles were expected to be treated by other nobles. It wasn\'t cheap to take care of prisoners. The result was the valuable POWs would end up in direct holding of their enemy nobles. Less valuable POWs may be held by others, but in generally they would be kept together in a more \\"pooled\\" situation; awaiting their ransom. Outright, independent messengers and negotiations would occur to secure funds (in many cases a mortgage) to pay the ransom. This process could take anywhere from days to months. It was quicker for those of lower status because they had less to be ransomed with, provided the enemy was willing to release men. Basically, individual nobles could be expected to secure their own ransom and could spend months in guarded quarters. It could also take a long time for a noble because his family could be forced to stand down in hostilities or else risk a punitive execution (think of wards and hostage exchanges, they are often there to ensure specific behavior or treaty compliance). Other times larger negotiations would be taking place, especially due to strategic importance of the war goals and to return men of lower status (the enemy may be unwilling to ransom dozens of captives back when they would simply re-arm and join the war). Furthermore, the lower classes of POWs wouldn\'t necessarily even have the agency\\/privilege of conducting their safe return and had to rely on their own side\'s nobility. All of such captives served as bargaining chips for negotiations and treaties. \\n\\nIn short,\\n\\nA noble could be expected to secure their own release, but since they were important and valuable, it could take months to hammer out the details.

To provide a little background, Sally Hemmings had a number of children, some of whom died in infancy, which are generally accepted as being fathered by Thomas Jefferson (I would direct to [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6aqa2e/panel_ama_slaves_and_slavers/dhj0rqm/?context=2) for more discussion, broadly, of the sexual relationships between masters and slaves in the antebellum South). Whether or not this was fact has been debated since before Jefferson himself died, and scholarly opinion has swayed about, but it is pretty much now the consensus.

Anyways though. Harriet, described as "nearly as white as anybody and very beautiful" had no trouble passing for white, and as you already are aware, made use of this. She was freed in 1822 at the age of 21, apparently on a promise Jefferson had made to Sally Hemings to do so when the children reached that age. The documentation of Harriet\'s liberation is almost next to nothing. Edmund Bacon, who worked as an overseer at Monticello, described her departure, being the one who gave her the $50 that you mention, and stating she had been headed for Philadelphia. And as for her life after she headed north, we only have one account which we can give any real credence to, that from her brother Madison, who wrote in 1873:

&gt;Harriet married a white man in good standing in Washington City, whose name I could give, but will not, for prudential reason. She raised a family of children, and so far as I know they were never suspected of being tainted with African blood in the community where she lived or lives. I have not heard from her for ten years, and do not know whether she is dead or alive. She thought it to her interest, on going to Washington, to assume the role of a white woman, and but her dress and conduct as such I am not aware that her identity as Harriet Hemings of Monticello has ever been discovered. 

Washington City in this case refers to the District of Columbia as it was then known, and it would appear that while she kept a low profile, she did not choose to cut all ties with her family, at least immediately, as Madison claims to have remained in contact with her through the 1860s (he was writing in 1873). He also gives us reason to believe it quite possible that she has living descendants, but of course was much to guarded to allow any information to get out which could give much of a thread to follow. What the end of communications even meant is up in the air - perhaps she decided to cut her final tie to non-white society, or perhaps she simply died. We can only speculate. But in any case, Madison\'s account is the lone source we can rely on to reconstruct any sense of her post-emancipation life.

She was not the only child of Jefferson and Hemmings to follow such a route. While Madison and Eston both left records, writings, and known descendants, their brother Beverley was similarly allowed to leave Monticello for the North, and even less seems sure about his fate then his sister, doing a similar disappearing act but without, it seems, even the record of correspondence that Harriet left He was briefly in contact, long enough to communicate back that he had married a white woman and that they had a daughter, living in Washington City, but that seems to be the end of it. In both the case of Beverley and Harriet, it should be noted, Jefferson *officially* recorded them as being escaped slaves, as their departure was recorded in the \'farm book\', but it was quite clearly allowed with his approval as a means of sending them North in technical compliance with the aforementioned agreement he had made with Sally. The backhanded means of liberation is thought to have been a means of following through without providing ammunition for those looking to prove the parentage.

Now, as to the second part of your question, you might perhaps want to x-post to /r/AskScience as it is less a history question that one for a geneticist. What I do understand of these things would imply that it is possible to find genetic matches that show relations by various degrees, but it isn\'t like those genes are signed "T.J." Establishing who that common ancestor is takes a lot more leg work. To compare to the famous claim about Genghis Khan\'s widespread DNA, this is based on finding the the same Y-chromosome (which records patrilineal descent) in millions of people that shows they share a common male ancestor a certain period back in time. Genghis Khan is then assumed to be the one based on historical circumstances. But I would hesitate to say more, as again, this is getting into the territory for a scientist to discuss.

None of the relevant historians here use that term, and in fact most of them argue strongly against it. I will reproduce some quotes from Annette Gordon-Reed, the scholar who is regarded as the leading authority on Jefferson-Hemings:\\n\\n&gt; The slave system was inherently coercive. Therefore, one could argue, every act of sex between a master and slave was the equivalent of nonconsensual sex, in other words, rape.\\n\\n&gt; We may know this is true in the theoretical sense, but something should tell us that it cannot have been true in every situation, under every circumstance, that existed from the early 1600s until emancipation. Do we really believe that over the entire course of slavery in the United States, no master and slave woman ever experienced a mutual sexual or emotional attachment to one another? Can we really believe that a slave woman confronted with a master whom she knew, or reasonably believed, would desist if she refused his advances was in the same position as a woman whose master would knock down the door and drag her off to his bedroom? Both women would have existed in a state of relative powerlessness. But we instinctively feel that there is a difference. In the former situation the woman would have had a small but important individualized bit of power even as she existed in a state of general powerlessness. The power was, of course, to say yes or no. In the latter situation her powerlessness would have been total.\\n\\n&gt; The idea of total powerlessness on the part of all slaves is attractive to both whites and blacks for different reasons. For some whites, even as they denounce the barbarity of slavery, the fantasy of white omnipotence may remain secretly appealing. Their presentation of slaves as having been totally helpless evinces sympathy for blacks, but it also imagines a time when whites allegedly had the power to rule blacks, mind, body, and soul. To admit that there might have been some instances when blacks exercised a degree of free will interrupts the dream of omnipotence and forces consideration of the ways in which that will may have been exercised and what effect it may have had upon whites.\\n\\n&gt; It is especially hard (and unpleasant) for some to think that a black woman might have exercised her will, circumscribed as it was, by saying yes to Thomas Jefferson and, in doing so, have been able to exercise some influence over him. Scholars have scoffed at the notion that Sally Hemings, no matter how beautiful or appealing, could have had enough power to extract a promise from Jefferson to free her children and then over the years hold him to that promise. Jefferson, the personification of America, simply cannot be put in that position. The actions he took with respect to Hemings\\u2019s children, for example, must be seen as a product of Jefferson\\u2019s will alone. It should not be considered for a moment that he may have been acting under the influence of so insignificant a person as a black female slave.\\n\\n&gt; The notion of total powerlessness has appeal to some blacks because it seems to make the slave system worse, as if that were possible. Saying that there were instances where blacks had room to maneuver can be taken as an attempt to minimize the horror of the slave system. This is not the case. The idea brings forth the truth that there were two sets of human beings involved in that sorry state of affairs, not one race of all powerful gods and another race of totally dominated submortals. While it is true that the balance of power dramatically favored whites, it is not true that blacks were unable to influence the lives of whites on an individual and societywide basis. No matter what amount of short-term gain may be achieved by focusing on black powerlessness (to trigger white guilt), it can never be in the long-term interests of blacks to accept so limited and distorted a version of history.\\n\\n- *Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy*, Page 109.\\n\\n&gt; For some, the reality that Jefferson \\u201ccould have\\u201d raped Hemings is the only reality that counts. For it is here that we find, in concentrated form, the evil of slavery, the enormous power that one group had to control and wreak havoc in the lives of another. The problem with making what Jefferson \\u201ccould have\\u201d done the sole question is that it suggests that the actual details of Hemings\\u2019s life are meaningless. This way of viewing African Americans has survived slavery and hints that some present-day considerations of Hemings and Jefferson, which typically proceed as discussions about the nature of slavery, are really discussions about experiences supposedly universal to all black people throughout American history. The erasure of individual black lives\\u2014 indeed, the assumption that the concept of individual as opposed to group identity is meaningless for blacks\\u2014 makes it hard to accept any presentation of a black life that moves beyond well-set, predetermined, and very limited parameters. Making what could have happened to black people as a group the only question about a given black person\\u2019s life saves one the effort of having to care about, discover, and analyze any of the details of that person\\u2019s life. The idea of black people matters more than actual black people themselves. What is known about a defined group is very useful for predicting what might happen in the life of one of its members that is yet unfolding. When the person\\u2019s life is over, however, what actually happened to him or her should take precedence over the almost infinite variety of things that could have happened. If we do not ignore specific information about Sally and James Hemings in favor of making a larger point about slaveholders\\u2019 overall power, we have evidence that sheds light on the nature of the relationship between Hemings and Jefferson. \\n\\n&gt; As to Sally Hemings, there is no one response to rape. It takes a huge liberty with her life, however, to assume that she was raped, and that she knew she could escape from her rapist forever, and for a time actually asserted her right to be free of him, but nevertheless decided to return with him to Virginia to live out the rest of her life having more forced sex. That construction too easily uses the fact that she was born a slave (and a black person) to presume an irreparably damaged, completely cowed, and irrational personality over one who had the capacity to know her circumstances and to intelligently use her knowledge to assess the risks and possible rewards of taking a particular action\\u2014 in other words, to think. Her son, who was clearly proud of her, depicted her as a person who thought rationally about her situation and came to a conclusion. In the absence of any specific information about her to rebut his portrayal, all that is left is stereotype. Too many enslaved women, with far fewer opportunities than Hemings had in France, complained about, resisted, and ran away from rape at the threat and cost of their lives, to assume that willing and unconsidered submission was the automatic response of any enslaved woman\\u2014 especially one who had an alternative. An even more staggering notion is that Hemings, who showed such obvious concern for her children\\u2019s future, would have \\u201cimplicitly relied\\u201d on a man who had violated any trust she could have had in him by forcing sex on her. What would such a vicious act have told an intelligent person about the likelihood that Jefferson would be honorable enough to carry out his promises to her at some distant point in the future? Nothing about the institution of slavery warrants an assumption that an enslaved woman in Hemings\\u2019s position in France would have operated at that level of mentality.\\n\\n&gt; [...] Her brother James knew the institution of slavery firsthand, including the special problems slave women faced. Aggressive as he was, we would not expect him to have exacted any direct reprisal if he believed Jefferson had raped his sister. We might think, however, that the rape of his sister would have meant something to him and affected his views about returning to Virginia with Jefferson, and his view of the man overall. Hemings, as we know, did return to America, and after he was a free man visited then Vice-President Jefferson, while he was in Philadelphia, talking to him about his past travel, his future travel plans, and life in general. Until the end of his too brief life, he told people he always kept his work situations open so that if Jefferson wanted to hire him as a chef\\u2014 for the right pay, of course\\u2014 he would be ready to go.\\n\\n&gt; American slavery, in and of itself, would not make an enslaved man act with such callous disregard of his sister\\u2019s life. Eighteenth-century enslaved siblings, perhaps echoing kinship traditions from Africa, were known to be especially close to one another. We see this very clearly in the Hemings family\\u2019s insistence on naming their children after one another down the generations. If they were not close before their time in France, James and Sally Hemings shared a very intense, life-altering experience together in an alien land. One cannot tell the sister\\u2019s story without telling the story of the brother; his responses to her situation speak to the kind of man he was.\\n\\n- *The Hemingses of Monticello*, Ch. 17.","edited":1513366503,"author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"is_submitter":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"body_html":"&lt;div class=\\"md\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I agree with your answer in general, I have to register my objection to your labeling of this as rape.

The Depression in Germany splintered public opinion. This led to a very unstable legislature in where no one party could govern effectively. As a result, there was an increasing reliance on government by emergency decree by otherwise mainstream parties. This established norms for authoritarianism and anti-democratic behaviour but had little to do with the Nazis. They were just a growing opposition party at this point, seen as outside realistic voting options for most. 

Hitler announced he would only seek power through elections in 1931, which helped solidify him as a viable political choice for the middle class, capitalists, military officers and other conservatives. Before that, Hitler and the Nazis were seen as ruffians outside the pale of good taste that appealed to angry violent yahoos. 

Hitler came a strong second in the January 1932 Presidential election to Hindenburg, and remained leader of a large but not in any way dominant political party. The Nazis were one of numerous parties in a highly fractured legislature. More parliamentary elections were held in July and November of 1932 but there was no ability to form a majority government that was stable, and the minority administrations were rudderless. 

After the November elections, a number of leading politicians and wealthy men appealed to President Hindenberg to appoint Hitler Chancellor in order to get stability. In January 1933, he came to power in a coalition with just three positions for the Nazis but critically, control of the police. 

That first week wasn\'t especially profound. But Hitler quickly dissolved the legislature and called for new elections to be held in early March. I\'m not sure if that was in the first week or not, but the calling of the elections wasn\'t especially crucial. 

Feburary 27, 1933 was crucial: The Reichstag building was set on fire. A Communist was found inside in incriminating circumstances, accused of the crime by the Nazi policing minister and the resulting political crisis gave Hitler the excuse to issue the Reichstag Fire Decree. He suspended basic rights and allowed arrest without trial. Mass arrests of communists and political opponents were combined with political violence and intense anti-communist propaganda. 

There is a near consensus that the fire was the work of that communist. There is a minority view that the Nazis had a role in setting the fire and framed the communists to give them the excuse to issue the decree and polarize the election against the communists. Either way, the fire gave Hitler the excuse to issue the decree and that was act that got him a dictatorship. 

The Nazis came short of a majority in the election. To remedy this, they proposed legislation giving Hitler a 4 year temporary dictatorship. This required a super majority in the House, and they didn\'t have the votes. So the Nazis used the Reichstag Fire Decree powers and their control of the police to arrest the communist members of the legislature. They also detained some of the Social Democrats and physically intimidated others. They created so much chaos and intimidation, and took away so many opposition votes, that they made their bill viable. 

On March 23, 1933, the Reichstag voted to grant Hitler those "temporary" powers to enact laws without the consent of the legislature. From here they expanded their campaign to outlawing the Social Democrats as well as the Communists, then dissolved all trade unions. Political opponents were sent to the concentration camps. By June, all other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. 

The first week in power wasn\'t that important. But democracy was completely dissolved within five months of Hitler assuming office and Germany turned into a one-party state that jailed and murdered opponents.

There was constant infighting at the top, which led the party line to lurch unpredictably and damped the ability of the party to really recruit during the early 1920\'s.

This radical-left went through a series of parties. First the Spartacus League formed soon after the end of the First World War. When one of their strike\\/demonstrations pulled more than half a million participants the more revolutionary among them launched an attempt to overthrow the government. The Spartacist Uprising in 1919 didn&amp;#39;t go so well between the anti-communist paramilitary force known as the Freikorps (mostly great war veterans who&amp;#39;d walked off with their military equipment) and a government that was still more in charge than it seemed at the time.&lt;\\/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Later, a Communist Party formed. But, it was torn between people who wanted violent overthrow of the government and those who wanted to democratically enact communism.

On Feb. 27, 1933, the German parliament building, the Reichstag, burned down. 

This is a key moment in the rise of Nazi Germany and one of the points at which Germany shifts from the Weimar Republic to a totalitarian state.

The Reichstag had been the heart of democratic Germany, a representative body that ─ even in 1933 ─ still held the belief that it answered to the people, not the state. The Nazi party held a minority of seats in that body. It had even lost 34 seats in the November 1932 election while the Communist Party gained 11 (for a total of 100). 

The Reichstag was by no means perfect. The Weimar government had shown its flaws, and the rise of Nazism had shown the Reichstag\'s conservative members to be willing to go along with the radical Nazis. The conservatives in the Reichstag believed Hitler was a buffoon, someone controllable even if he got into power as chancellor. They were not captivated by his speeches (in general) and believed he was less extreme than he actually was. With Hindenburg as president, the conservatives believed that Hitler would be checked, and the Nazis could be brought into the fold safely. Things worked out differently, of course.

When the fire took place, Hitler and his closest advisers saw that it was a golden opportunity. A young Dutch Communist had been arrested at the scene, and so they were quick to declare the fire an arson, a communist plot designed, as Goebbels wrote in his diary, "to sow confusion in order, in the general panic, to grasp power for themselves."

Many people have claimed in the years since the fire that it was entirely orchestrated by the Nazis as a pretext to seize power. Many others have claimed that there\'s little evidence of a conspiracy, and that the Nazi leadership was simply opportunistic. [Richard Evans\' 2014 review of *Burning the Reichstag* is a wonderfully detailed breakdown of the arguments](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n09/richard-j-evans/the-conspiracists). 

In the end, I\'m not sure whether it matters all that much. In either case, the Nazis called the fire an act of terrorism, and in order to fight terrorism, they needed to improve security. In order to improve security, they needed new powers for the state, and they needed to make arrests. Nazi party members were enrolled as auxiliary policemen, and overnight they arrested hundreds ─ if not thousands ─ of communists and left-wing politicians and political organizers. Disregarding parliamentary immunity, the Nazis seized the leaders of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party.

The morning after the fire, the German cabinet ─ which, like the Reichstag, had a non-Nazi majority ─ drew up an emergency decree designed to ensure security. It abolished freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, legalized phone-tapping, suspended the freedom of some of the German states, and in general meant the end of free government in Germany.

Using the terrorist attack at the Reichstag as a pretext, the Nazis pushed through the emergency decree, which was signed by a wavering Hindenburg. 

Now, with unprecedented power as Chancellor, Hitler was able to brow-beat his opponents. Less than a week after the emergency decree passed and the Nazis had been able to unleash a firestorm of violence against their opponents, a new federal election was held. The Nazis still tallied only 44 percent of the vote, despite their actions, but it was enough.

Two weeks after the election, the Nazis were able to gain enough votes from non-socialists to pass the Enabling Acts. These acts gave Hitler and his ministers exclusive legislative power. The president and the Reichstag were sidelined.

By the summer of 1933, all opposition was crushed. More than 100,000 people had been sent to concentration camps. Thousands more were murdered. All independent political parties were dissolved. Only the Nazis remained.

It happened that quickly. There were less than four months between Germany\'s last free elections, in November 1932, and the passage of the Enabling Acts in March 1933. If you want to learn more about this, read Richard Evans\' *The Coming of the Third Reich.* It\'s widely published and easy to understand.

Now that I\'ve told you what I think, let me actually answer your question.

On the night that Hitler became Reich Chancellor, Goebbels organized a torchlight parade in Berlin with some 60,000 participants. Some observers noted in their journals that Goebbels had the marchers go in a circle, so as to pass the reviewing stand at least twice in order to create the impression of greater numbers. There were still plenty of cheers regardless.

Though the Nazis put on a show of force with the parade and other events, they were careful to stage the production as a show of support for Hindenburg, to say that the parades were a "tribute to Hindenburg" and that they were not truly disrupting the traditional order. There were marches in other cities as well, and occasional violent clashes with Communists. There was a shootout in Spandau, shots fired from a house in Charlottenburg at a march. Copies of the communist party newspaper were seized and burned.

Generally, however, the leftist parties and left-center parties tried to keep a low profile, fearing a government crackdown on their operations. There was local opposition, but nothing organized at a national level.

Four days after taking the Chancellorship, Hitler made moves to keep the leadership of the German Army neutral. He feared a coup, and to reduce the chance of that, he spoke to Army leaders and pledged to do many of the things they favored ─ fight the Treaty of Versailles, restore conscription, and destroy Marxism.

On Feb. 4, the cabinet issued a decree allowing the government to detain for up to three months (without trial) people who used weapons to breach the peace. It was targeted at people resisting Nazi stormtroopers. 

Before Hitler became Chancellor, the Prussian police had been keeping an eye on Nazis and other paramilitaries who caused trouble. The police might not have been able to act against these armed groups because of political considerations, but they still investigated them. Hitler ordered those investigations to stop.

In the middle of February, Hitler also created an auxiliary police force made up of Nazi paramilitaries, in effect putting Nazi violence under the protection of the police.

In the beginning of February, the Nazi minister of the Interior, Wilhelm Frick, and Hermann Goring (the minister of the Interior for Prussia) began banning Social Democratic newspapers. The Social Democrats responded by suing, which had some success.

As the month went on, the Social Democrats began to join the Communists as targets of violence from Nazi paramilitaries. In response, the Social Democrats tried to stick to a legalistic defense. They did not want to respond to Nazi violence with violence of their own, an act that would encourage a heavy-handed response from the federal government.

In Wurttemberg State, the president, Eugen Bolz, declared the new government to be an enemy of freedom. Hitler responded that Bolz had no room to talk, since he hadn\'t protected the Nazi Party when it was persecuted in the 1920s.

"Those who made no mention of our freedom for 14 years have no right to talk about it today. As Chancellor I need only use one law for the protection of the national state, just as they made a law for the protection of the Republic back then, and then they would realize that not everything they called freedom was worthy of the name," Hitler said in a speech.

While the Nazi paramilitaries were making enemies of the Social Democrats and the Communists (and to a lesser extent, the Centre Party), there were plenty of people in Germany who delighted in what he was doing. Remember, this was the Great Depression, and there were many in Germany who enjoyed his actions.

Evans quotes the diary of a woman named Louise Solmitz:

"I’m delighted at Hitler’s lack of a programme, for a programme is either lies, weakness, or designed to catch silly birds. ─ The strongman acts from the necessity of a serious situation and can’t allow himself to be bound."

'body' => 'There was a prominent \'yes\' campaign in the 1967 referendum, run by the organisation Federal Council for the Advancement Of Aboriginals And Torres Strait Islanders, which had posters, advertisements in papers, and even advertising jingles on radio ([there are some examples of editorials and ads here](http://indigenousrights.net.au/civil_rights/the_referendum,_1957-67/campaigning_for_a_yes_vote)). In contrast, there was *no* significant \'no\' campaign in the 1967 referendum - which made it unique amongst Australian referenda. 

In parliament, all of the major parties supported a \'yes\' vote, and so there was no published \'case\' for a \'no\' vote in the parliamentary record. And this was the point, in a way: the referendum to amend the references to indigenous people in the constitution was a surefire thing that the huge majority of people had agreed on by 1967 (successful referendums being necessary to change the Australian constitution). The government of the time hoped to get up another, more controversial, amendment to the constitution relating to Federal vs state powers, and were hoping that that amendment would piggyback its way to success on the more popular one. 

It should be said that there\'s some controversy over the meaning of the constitutional amendment to omit the mentions of indigenous peoples in the constitutions; it\'s more complicated than \'recognising Aboriginals as Australian citizens\'. Attwood and Markus in 1998 argued that its implications for the legal rights and status of indigenous peoples in Australia were slight, as in most states Aborigines had already had the rights of citizens, such as the right to vote (apart from, sort of, in Western Australia and Queensland). Attwood and Markus argue that the change was largely symbolic for this reason. Elsewhere, Taffe in 2007 argued that the real change that resulted from the constitutional amendment was that Aboriginal affairs was no longer a state but rather a Federal responsibility. Where, previously, Federal governments had argued that indigenous people were the responsibility of the states, they no longer had this particular excuse; as a result, for example, the Whitlam government set up a department of Aboriginal Affairs in 1972. 

There are a few reasons why the \'yes\' vote was popular, especially amongst the majority of the Australian population that lived in cities. By 1967, the advent of television in the 1950s had opened many eyes to how difficult conditions were for indigenous peoples. Additionally, the Australian public was aware of international opprobrium about the Apartheid of South Africa, and did not want to become an international pariah, and the referendum seemed a clear way to demonstrate that. And in the 1960s there was a new-found prominence for indigenous rights activists, such as organisations like FCAATSI. And as the change was in many ways symbolic, there were few real grounds for opposition to it, as nobody particularly felt they would lose out (which perhaps might have been different if the consitutional amendments clearly implied the land rights which came about after the Mabo decision in the 1990s, for example).

In general, advocacy for the \'no\' vote was largely seen in public in letters to the editor, and was often quite racist; one letter to the editor of the *Adelaide Advertiser* claimed the vote would propel indigenous people "into the turmoil of a civilization they probably do not understand and do not want". More genteel arguments against the amendment revolved around arguments for states\' rights, which would be undermined by the change to the constitution. However, even this was quite muted; the Premier of Queensland, Frank Nicklin, appears to have had assurances by Harold Holt that they would continue working with the states on Aboriginal Affairs. There\'s also some suggestion that state Premiers were happy to handball responsibility for a difficult portfolio - that they probably did not understand and did not want - to the Federal government.

The highest \'no\' vote was in Western Australia, where there was a 20% no vote. Western Australia of course had a successful referendum to secede from Australia in 1933 (which was ignored by the Federal parliament), which is emblematic of Western Australians having less trust in the distant, Eastern-based Federal Government than the rest of Australia. There were also higher \'no\' votes in country areas - the highest being in Kalgoorlie in country Western Australia, which almost hit 30% (and which still has some significant and highly publicised tensions between the indigenous and white parts of its community).

'body_html' => '&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a prominent &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; campaign in the 1967 referendum, run by the organisation Federal Council for the Advancement Of Aboriginals And Torres Strait Islanders, which had posters, advertisements in papers, and even advertising jingles on radio (&lt;a href="http://indigenousrights.net.au/civil_rights/the_referendum,_1957-67/campaigning_for_a_yes_vote"&gt;there are some examples of editorials and ads here&lt;/a&gt;). In contrast, there was &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; significant &amp;#39;no&amp;#39; campaign in the 1967 referendum - which made it unique amongst Australian referenda. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parliament, all of the major parties supported a &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; vote, and so there was no published &amp;#39;case&amp;#39; for a &amp;#39;no&amp;#39; vote in the parliamentary record. And this was the point, in a way: the referendum to amend the references to indigenous people in the constitution was a surefire thing that the huge majority of people had agreed on by 1967 (successful referendums being necessary to change the Australian constitution). The government of the time hoped to get up another, more controversial, amendment to the constitution relating to Federal vs state powers, and were hoping that that amendment would piggyback its way to success on the more popular one. &lt;/p&gt;

'body' => 'While i\'m far from knowledgeable in that area, it seems that scholarship on the 1917-1919 Famine is sorely lacking. The main text appears to be *The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919* by Mohammad Gholi Majd. However, Majd\'s thesis has taken some hits, according to reviewer Willem Floor, Majd makes three assertions:

* “the 1917-18 famine in Iran was caused by British intervention in Iran”

* “as a result 40 percent or 9 million of the population died”

* “the subject of the famine and the resulting genocide has been ignored by scholars so far”

To begin, Majd goes to great lengths to pick and choose his sources, ignoring sources within the British archives and over-relying on US sources, and those British sources he does use (the diaries of the British generals whom he blames the famine on) work against his theory that the British government acted to exacerbate the famine. It seems far more likely that the famine was caused by a combination of Russo-Turkish fighting and foraging in Iran, poor harvests, and bad weather conditions in the grain producing regions of Persia. Additionally, in rural areas, the famine was aggravated by the presence of those hoarding grain whose effect was minimized in places such as Tehran when local authorities took control of the food supply and dispersed it as necessary. 

On the second point, Majd’s choice of 9 million is likely inaccurate as he picks and chooses his census data, ignoring more accurate numbers taken from demographer Bharier:

&gt; “The author rejects the population figures for 1914 as calculated by Bharier using the backward regressive analysis, which is a standard demographic tool. Majd does not explain why he faults the methodology and assumptions used by Bharier. He only states that Bharier failed to mention the occurrence of the famine and therefore his data are wrong. Moreover, the US consul stated that in 1914 the population of Iran was 20 million, a figure that is credible given that the number of votes in the Tehran elections also shows that the population of Tehran was in the order of 400,000. Majd does not cite or discuss any other estimates by contemporaries that offer much lower, and in my estimation, more realistic figures. In 1919, the population of Tehran was 200,000 and the population of Iran as a whole was 11 million, according to Bharier. Ergo, a genocide of 9 million people. Majd does not explain why he has confidence in Bharier\'s 1919 population figure (p. 52) but not in his 1914 figure”

The *Cambridge History of Iran Vol. 7* agree with Bharier’s numbers and Dr. Mahmood Messkoub writes in *Social Policy in Iran in the Twentieth Century* "Majd claims that the famine of 1917-1919 killed half the population, an exaggeration surely that does not tally well with the evidence provided in his otherwise useful overview of famine in that period."

Floor tentatively agrees with Majd’s third point stating:  “It is true that so far few historians have dealt with the 1917-18 famine, and after having read this book I think there is a real need that somebody does. Majd\'s objective is not to understand why the famine happened and why its impact was so devastating... for he only wants to show Albion\'s perfidy and assign blame. “

I found a paper discussing the effects that the 1918 flu pandemic had on Iran, and it included some background about the effect of WWI on the Iranian populace as well. A lot of this post is taken directly from this article, either verbatim or slightly paraphrased. (The citation is : Amir Afkhami.

So Iran declared its neutrality during WWI, but despite this the great powers used Iran as a battlefield at times. Russia and Britain both had imperialist designs on Iran for various reasons, interfering with its internal politics to try and secure their own interests, and as a result it became a target during the war. Some of the incidents during the war include: the Ottomans chasing the Russians into northwestern Azerbaijan in 1914; In 1915 Wilhelm Wassmuss organized a revolt among the Qashghai tribesman in southern Iran against the British who controlled oilfields in the area; The Russians counterattacked the Ottomans allowing the British to recover control of Southern Iran by 1916; A revolutionary Iranian group called the Jangalis emerged to control the countryside of Gilan in 1917-1918; Britain also tried to use Iran as a springboard to attack Russia in an attempt to reverse the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the new Soviet Union responded by annexing parts of northern Iran.

As a result of the warfare occurring in Iran, there was damage to Iran\'s economic, industrial and agricultural power. The occupying armies forcefully requisitioned or looted supplies. This led to widespread famine and the spread of disease. Iran\'s government was also essentially a protectorate surviving at the whims of whichever power was present and winning at the time, leaving them with little ability to actually help their own people. In addition, Ahmad Shah Qajar, the ruler of Iran at the time, was a weak ruler with little influence in his own government. The populace resented his father for authoritarian policies, and in an attempt to address this, Ahmad Shah tried to appoint only the best ministers, but he was unable to control their actions. In the face of the great powers of WWI using their country as a battlefield, and the threat of the Soviet Invasion and their humiliating demands, the populace resented the government\'s weakness, contributing to the political instability.

While political instability and warfare can lead to famines, the biggest cause is often climatic. 1916 and 1917 were both years with very dry summers, leading to crop failures. This, coupled with the foreign armies seizing what food they could, resulted in widespread famine, which was worsened by hoarders and speculators. When the influenza pandemic broke out in the spring of 1918, grain supplies had hit a low point, prices had doubled from six months before, (which had reached a ten-year peak). In addition, there were outbreaks of bubonic plague, cholera, malaria and typhus. The British were also building up for their attack on the Soviet Union, and sponsoring a native military contingent known as the "South Persia Rifles", making long-term contracts with large landowners for grain to feed the troops, adding to the scarcity.

F.A.C. Forbes-Leith describes the situation in what I assume is a memoir, Checkmate: Fighting Tradition in Central Persia. (I haven\'t read the actual book and am using a citation from Afkhami\'s article).

&gt;"The country was in a terrible state and the peasantry was in the last stages of starvation. Every time I was forced to stop my car, I was surrounded by hundreds of near-skeletons who screamed and fought for such scraps as I was able to spare. In a single day\'s journey of fifty-six miles between the towns of Kirind and Kermanshah, I counted twenty-seven corpses by the roadside, most of them those of women and children, and the general condition of life amongst the peasants was so frightful that I was ashamed to eat my simple rations in their presence."

So the Iranian famine of 1917-1918 was primarily a man-made catastrophe exacerbated by climatic conditions in which there was also an influx of infectious diseases. The wikipedia listing states that Majd\'s initial population estimate of 19 million is called into question with other estimates only being 11 million. Afkhami\'s article says that Iran\'s projected population at the beginning of 1918 was 11 million, so it may be that the 19 million number comes from *before* WWI broke out, and after the famine it had hit 11 million, at which point the influenza pandemic hit, killing a further 8% to 21% of the population according to Afkhami. (0.8 to 2.3 million). Although Afkhami\'s footnotes say that the population in 1918 was not too different from the population in 1913, before the war, which I am not sure whether to believe or not, given the effects of famine prior to the flu\'s arrival.',

'body' => 'It was a bit frustrating to see this on the front page without any answers, so I\'ve decided to do a little research of my own ^with ^the ^help ^of ^Google. 

From what I gather, there has not been much scholarly work on the topic. The most-cited book I found was Mohammad Gholi Majd\'s *The Great Famine &amp; Genocide in Iran* (available in [preview mode on Google Books](https://books.google.be/books?id=5WgSAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)).

You can also have a look at [*Iran and Its Place Among Nations,*](https://books.google.be/books?id=PO_s9H5QTp4C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=iran+famine+1917&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUlrC_7oXOAhUGXRoKHVbqDXYQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=iran%20famine%201917&amp;f=false) which provides a summary of Majd\'s argument.
&gt;One of the little known calamities of World War I and its aftermath in Iran is the widespread famine that the war engendered across the country. The most significant treatment of this subject is the book by the agricultural economist Mohammed-Gholi Majd, *The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919.* [...] Majid quotes the American charge d\'affaires in Persia at the time, Wallace Smith Muray, as having claimed that in 1917-1918, up to one-third of Iran\'s population was wiped out by famine and disease. 

&gt;To be sure, the exact causes of the devastating famine are difficult to grasp. Majd blames the British who, after the Russian revolution of 1917, had become the main foreign power in Iran. Having isolated farmers from their customers inside Iran the British, Majd claims, made it impossible for the country\'s fertile regions in its north and northwest to remain connected to the rest of the country. At the same time, according to Majd, a significant amount of the grains produced in Iran were forcibly acquired for British troops in the country and shipped abroad to other British troops in the region.

&gt;Majd concludes that, unbeknownst to most, one of the main genocides of the twentieth century occured in Iran during and immediately after World War I.

However, the authors also point out:

&gt;It is difficult for rigorous academic research to corroborate these figures. The word "genocide" implies the willful killing of large numbers of noncombatants. The historical record in this area is murky. A more extensive scholarly treatment of this subject would have to utilize "triangulation" and provide evidence from others, including British, Russian, and Ottoman sources, to show the extent of the famine and the ways in which it was affected by the war and its aftermath. 

And, if you have access to JSTOR, you can also find [another review of Majd\'s argument by Persia scholar Willem Floor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4311715?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). He is very critical of Majd - going as far as sarcasm:

&gt;So good were the British in concealing that there even had been a famine that the document tabled by the official Persian delegation to the Versailles peace treaty trivialized the famine and obscured its causes [...] The scheme worked so well that scholars dealing with Iran, even if they did know about, did not write about it, until now. 

The thrust of Floor\'s argument is that Majd\'s estimate of the Iranian population is far too high and that he has it out against the British. He suggests reading James Barton\'s *Story of Near East Relief 1915-1930* for a overview of the difficulties of famine-relief in the broader region.

Barton points to light snowfall in the winter, spring drought and the breakdown of the irrigation system as partially responsible for famine in Iran\'s Kermanshah and Hamadan provinces. 

So, as you can see, there\'s some debate around this famine. I\'m surprised there is no Wikipedia article about it.',
'body_html' => '&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a bit frustrating to see this on the front page without any answers, so I&amp;#39;ve decided to do a little research of my own &lt;sup&gt;with&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;the&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;help&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;of&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Google.&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I gather, there has not been much scholarly work on the topic. The most-cited book I found was Mohammad Gholi Majd&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Great Famine &amp;amp; Genocide in Iran&lt;/em&gt; (available in &lt;a href="https://books.google.be/books?id=5WgSAAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;preview mode on Google Books&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also have a look at &lt;a href="https://books.google.be/books?id=PO_s9H5QTp4C&amp;amp;pg=PA16&amp;amp;dq=iran+famine+1917&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUlrC_7oXOAhUGXRoKHVbqDXYQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=iran%20famine%201917&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iran and Its Place Among Nations,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which provides a summary of Majd&amp;#39;s argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the little known calamities of World War I and its aftermath in Iran is the widespread famine that the war engendered across the country. The most significant treatment of this subject is the book by the agricultural economist Mohammed-Gholi Majd, &lt;em&gt;The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919.&lt;/em&gt; [...] Majid quotes the American charge d&amp;#39;affaires in Persia at the time, Wallace Smith Muray, as having claimed that in 1917-1918, up to one-third of Iran&amp;#39;s population was wiped out by famine and disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the exact causes of the devastating famine are difficult to grasp. Majd blames the British who, after the Russian revolution of 1917, had become the main foreign power in Iran. Having isolated farmers from their customers inside Iran the British, Majd claims, made it impossible for the country&amp;#39;s fertile regions in its north and northwest to remain connected to the rest of the country. At the same time, according to Majd, a significant amount of the grains produced in Iran were forcibly acquired for British troops in the country and shipped abroad to other British troops in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Majd concludes that, unbeknownst to most, one of the main genocides of the twentieth century occured in Iran during and immediately after World War I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the authors also point out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult for rigorous academic research to corroborate these figures. The word &amp;quot;genocide&amp;quot; implies the willful killing of large numbers of noncombatants. The historical record in this area is murky. A more extensive scholarly treatment of this subject would have to utilize &amp;quot;triangulation&amp;quot; and provide evidence from others, including British, Russian, and Ottoman sources, to show the extent of the famine and the ways in which it was affected by the war and its aftermath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if you have access to JSTOR, you can also find &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4311715?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"&gt;another review of Majd&amp;#39;s argument by Persia scholar Willem Floor&lt;/a&gt;. He is very critical of Majd - going as far as sarcasm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So good were the British in concealing that there even had been a famine that the document tabled by the official Persian delegation to the Versailles peace treaty trivialized the famine and obscured its causes [...] The scheme worked so well that scholars dealing with Iran, even if they did know about, did not write about it, until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thrust of Floor&amp;#39;s argument is that Majd&amp;#39;s estimate of the Iranian population is far too high and that he has it out against the British. He suggests reading James Barton&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Story of Near East Relief 1915-1930&lt;/em&gt; for a overview of the difficulties of famine-relief in the broader region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barton points to light snowfall in the winter, spring drought and the breakdown of the irrigation system as partially responsible for famine in Iran&amp;#39;s Kermanshah and Hamadan provinces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as you can see, there&amp;#39;s some debate around this famine. I&amp;#39;m surprised there is no Wikipedia article about it.&lt;/p&gt;

'body' => 'I have taken several courses on the history of the ME, but this topic in particular is highly politicized; original documents are highly biased depending on whether they are written by those sympathetic to British or Iranian interests.  The most informative piece of work on this topic is probably [Mohammad Gholi Majd\'s 2013 book](https://books.google.com/books?id=5WgSAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).

Generally speaking, there was a famine in the area, exacerbated by British, Russian, and Ottoman forces fighting for control of the area.  

In more detail:

Some documents show that the population of Iran was 12 million in 1900, 15 million in 1910, and projections put it at 18-20 million in 1920.  But, census records in 1920 put the population at 10 million, suggesting that "8-10 million" people died, per [Mohammad Gholi Majd](https://books.google.com/books?id=5WgSAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).

Edit: Another user has commented on the veracity of these numbers and, while s/he notes that they are inaccurate, I believe his/her net assessment of the casualties results in a similar conclusion to the one I reach in the following paragraph.  

I have not verified whether the census methodologies were consistent, nor have I attempted to vet the records noted by Gholi Majd in his book for internal consistency.  The urban statistics suggest a somewhat more modest reduction in net population.  In wartime, and during famine, there is usually a disproportionate reduction in urban population density relative to rural areas [(Bradley Thayer, 2009](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781832/); [Alex de Sherbinin, 1995)](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/report1a.pdf#page=24), and Tehran\'s population fell from 500,000 to 200,000 in this period (again, per Gholi Majd).  This isn\'t conclusive, but I would estimate gross casualties at ~5-7 million based on this figure.  Also important to note: the famine occurred some years prior to 1920, so using a 1920 population estimate to back-calculate a death toll from 1917-1918 or 1919 is going to give an inflated number.  In short, the author\'s "8-10 million" figure is almost certainly too high.  

Regardless, it looks as though we can be *certain* that somewhere between 3 and 10 million people died, and the figure is likely towards the middle to upper end of that spectrum.

As to why it happened: there would have been a famine in Iran due to poor harvests, without any wars.  But, fighting between the occupying British, Russian, and Ottoman forces significantly exacerbated the problem.  Per Gholi Majd, British military grain and rice purchases from within Iran for the period were in excess of 500,000 tons (Russian &amp; Ottoman figures not noted). This was seen as a savvy move, as the grain would otherwise have required importation from ~India, and it saved British shipping capacity for the Atlantic theatre.  The British and Russian (and Ottoman?) armies destroyed grain reserves in towns that they thought might be occupied by the other side(s) in the future.  The author also notes that the acting Iranian government saw an extreme reduction in revenue as a result of the conflict, and was unable to alleviate the famine.  He blames this on Britain\'s manipulation of currency re. oil exports, but I can\'t comment on the accuracy of this claim without extensive additional research.  Gholi Majd goes into much greater detail re. a number of British military decisions and policies that exacerbated the famine locally.  

Contemporary documents say that the famine ended in 1918, but Gholi Majd suggests that it continued into 1919.  This is politically relevant, because fighting between Britain and Russia had ended by early 1918.  I don\'t want to get into the details, but, if the famine continued into 1919, post-war British policy may have been responsible for some of the casualties.  

Contemporary media commented on the fact that the Russian army looted and contributed to the shortage as well, but Gholi Majd downplays their influence by suggesting that "famine already stalked the land."  It\'s odd, because the exact same could be said for Britain\'s responsibility for the situation.  As best I can tell, Gholi Majd has a particular bone to pick with Britain.  If you read between the lines, it sounds as though the author is angry that Britain *chose* to feed its armies with locally-sourced grain, as opposed to using additional resources to import it.  Russia (apparently?) lacked similar logistic capabilities, so he sees them as less culpable.  This gets kind of wishy-washy, because the author uses historical facts to try to explore how the situation *could have been avoided* and devotes an entire chapter to explicitly address who should be blamed.  He very clearly holds Britain accountable.  

There is also ~no mention of the Ottoman army/actions beyond some sparse notes regarding the timeline of their fighting with Britain well into 1918.  As best I can tell, Gholi Majd ~ignores the actions of the Russians and Ottomans, in preference to those of the British.  But, again, I\'m not sifting through other original sources.  

I also don\'t know what proportion of the grain consumed by Britain or Russian (or Ottoman) forces would have made its way to the Iranian people, so it\'s hard for me to blame either party for a set proportion of the final death toll.  They are responsible for some number of the dead.  Possibly millions.  Probably not as many as 8-10 million.

TL;DR There was a famine and a war being fought by outside parties.  3-10 million people died, mostly of starvation.  The fighting between Britain and Russia is to blame for at least some of the deaths.
