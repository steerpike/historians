I was shocked out how versatile this plant was-- the leaves were edible, the roots could be roasted as a coffee substitute, the milky sap inside the stem was said to have medicinal properties, and the flower tops could even be bottled and made into wine! 

How and why did the dandelion come to be known as nothing more than a pesky weed? It seems like this flower got the raw end of the deal.

**EDIT:** Wow. First of all, let me say that I am deeply thankful for the insightful, in-depth responses provided by both /u/gothwalk and /u/WRCousCous. You both have gone above and beyond in addressing my query, and I did not expect such expert-level responses to my question about the humble dandelion.

Secondly, I am blown away with how popular this post has become. I cannot believe that it is the most highly upvoted question of all time in /r/AskHistorians. I hope this has exposed many people to the lost arts of foraging plants for food and medicine. This is something I feel that everyone should know more about.

You might have missed it in the flood of political news lately, but [President Trump\'s budget proposal](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/arts/nea-neh-endowments-trump.html?_r=0) proposes to defund the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (which helps fund PBS and NPR stations).

You may recall that we [ran a previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/) on this topic when the proposal was just a rumor, but now that it\'s an official proposal we decided to update this and ask you to take action. 

The mission of /r/Askhistorians is to provide high-quality historical answers to a wide audience. We usually work online, through [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/askhistorians), [our Tumblr account](http://askhistorians.tumblr.com/), and here, but that\'s not all we do. [We talk to historians and bring them here for AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/amas). We have (with your help) [presented at historical conferences](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/february-2016/have-a-question-about-the-past-askhistorians). We also advocate: for good history, for civil discussion, and for keeping historical research going.

That\'s what we\'re doing today, and we need your help. 

We don\'t get political for a particular candidate, a particular party, or a particular point of view. We get political when good history matters. **If you\'re American, we\'re asking you to call your Congressmen and Congresswomen to support funding for the NEA and NEH.**

The federal budget process isn\'t fast, and it isn\'t straightforward, but it *is* changeable. Each February, when the president submits his or her budget to Congress, there\'s a better chance of a cow getting through a slaughterhouse untouched than that budget staying in the same form. That\'s why your calls matter: Congress catches a lot of flak, but it does do work, particularly in the details of the budget.

And we say *call*, not email, because calls matter. It\'s easy to ignore an email; you probably do it a few times on any given day. It\'s a lot harder to ignore a phone call. [Call your Senators and Congresswoman](https://www.govtrack.us/). You won\'t talk to them directly; you\'ll talk to a staffer or an intern answering phones. They\'ve been getting a lot of calls lately. Chances are, they\'ll have a local office as well as their DC office. If you can\'t get through to one, try the other.

Don\'t call other Congressmen than your own. It\'s a waste of time. Don\'t follow a script; those tend to get ignored. Just say who you are, where you\'re calling from (city/zip code, if you don\'t want to give your address), and what you\'re calling about.

Repetition helps. Put the numbers in your cellphone and give \'em a call when you\'re headed to work or have a spare minute or two. It doesn\'t take a lot of time, but it can make a world of good.

Why are you calling?

The National Endowment for the Humanities funds a lot of good things. If you\'ve seen Ken Burns\' documentary *The Civil War,* you\'ve seen some of its work. If you\'ve read *Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-45*, you\'ve seen some of its work. If you\'ve visited your local museum, chances are that it too received some NEH funding.

There\'s something else important: **NEH funding indirectly supports what you\'re reading right now.**

Many of our moderators, flaired commentators and even ordinary users have jobs that are funded in part or wholly by NEH grants. They have the spare time to offer their knowledge and skills here because of those grants. A lot of the links we provide in our answers exist because of the NEH. [The *Discovering America* digital newspaper archive is supported by the NEH.](https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/)

The NEH does all of that with just $143 million per year in federal funding. That\'s just 0.003 percent of the federal budget. If you make $40,000 a year and spent that much of your income, you\'d be spending $1.20.

For all the NEH does, that\'s a good deal. 

------- 

The previous post had three comments in reply that I\'d like to highlight here: 

* u/restricteddata on the [history of the NEH](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/dd52t3d/)

* u/khosikulu on the [types of grants](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/dd5xiok/) offered by the NEH

* u/the_alaskan on how the NEH [benefits many people who aren\'t historians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/dd3sffh/)

------- 

Edited to add this, from u/caffarelli: 

&gt; If you\'re making a call for NEA/NEH, please also take a moment to mention [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/news-events/news-releases/institute-museum-and-library-services-issues-statement-presidents-proposed) which is also on the block, and to be crude, odds are better you\'ll personally be impacted by it\'s loss more quickly than any of the other federal humanities funding. IMLS funding is of particular importance to rural libraries and Native American museums and libraries, and can sometimes be the bulk of funding at those libraries. But if you\'re a patron of smaller public library, your library probably only got the Internet because of an IMLS grant, because that was their largest grant impact during the 90s-00s. It\'s a quiet, effective and responsible distributor of tiny amounts of federal money, that have nevertheless had an out-sized impact on the quality of public library services available in America.

If you&amp;#39;ve read &lt;em&gt;Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-45&lt;/em&gt;, you&amp;#39;ve seen some of its work. If you&amp;#39;ve visited your local museum, chances are that it too received some NEH funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s something else important: &lt;strong&gt;NEH funding indirectly supports what you&amp;#39;re reading right now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of our moderators, flaired commentators and even ordinary users have jobs that are funded in part or wholly by NEH grants. They have the spare time to offer their knowledge and skills here because of those grants. A lot of the links we provide in our answers exist because of the NEH. &lt;a href="https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Discovering America&lt;/em&gt; digital newspaper archive is supported by the NEH.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NEH does all of that with just $143 million per year in federal funding. That&amp;#39;s just 0.003 percent of the federal budget. If you make $40,000 a year and spent that much of your income, you&amp;#39;d be spending $1.20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the NEH does, that&amp;#39;s a good deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous post had three comments in reply that I&amp;#39;d like to highlight here: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/u/the_alaskan"&gt;u/the_alaskan&lt;/a&gt; on how the NEH &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/dd3sffh/"&gt;benefits many people who aren&amp;#39;t historians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edited to add this, from &lt;a href="/u/caffarelli"&gt;u/caffarelli&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re making a call for NEA/NEH, please also take a moment to mention &lt;a href="https://www.imls.gov/news-events/news-releases/institute-museum-and-library-services-issues-statement-presidents-proposed"&gt;Institute of Museum and Library Services&lt;/a&gt; which is also on the block, and to be crude, odds are better you&amp;#39;ll personally be impacted by it&amp;#39;s loss more quickly than any of the other federal humanities funding. IMLS funding is of particular importance to rural libraries and Native American museums and libraries, and can sometimes be the bulk of funding at those libraries. But if you&amp;#39;re a patron of smaller public library, your library probably only got the Internet because of an IMLS grant, because that was their largest grant impact during the 90s-00s. It&amp;#39;s a quiet, effective and responsible distributor of tiny amounts of federal money, that have nevertheless had an out-sized impact on the quality of public library services available in America. &lt;/p&gt;

This is only the first piece where we explain what we are and why we do, what we do and more is to follow in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: As promised, &lt;a href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/facebook-is-feeding-the-holocaust-deniers-it-should-shut-them-down-1.6294410"&gt;here is another piece on this subject, this time in the English edition of Haaretz!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Up to that time I had known about it only generally or through secondary sources. I am certain, however that I have never at any other time experienced an equal sense of shock.



&gt; I visited every nook and cranny of the camp because I felt it my duty to be in a position from then on to testify at first hand about these things in case there ever grew up at home the belief or assumption that `the stories of Nazi brutality were just propaganda.’ Some members of the visiting party were unable to through the ordeal. I not only did so but as soon as I returned to Patton’s headquarters that evening I sent communications to both Washington and London, urging the two governments to send instantly to Germany a random group of newspaper editors and representative groups from the national legislatures. I felt that the evidence should be immediately placed before the American and British publics in a fashion that would leave no room for cynical doubt.



1. Was this information ever presented to the public in a widespread manner? What form did Eisenhower\'s "evidence" he wanted placed "before the American and British publics" specifically take? Did he take specific actions during his Presidency to enshrine the events of the Holocaust? Did General Eisenhower ever give congressional, tribunal or otherwise official legal testimony like he stated he wanted to in regards to what he witnessed?


2. Did Holocaust denial occur immediately after the war? How did allied commanders or leadership react to this phenomenon? 


3. Did other allied reprisals occur apart from Dachau in response to what soldiers witnessed at the concentration camps? 



4. Was the phrase "I felt it my duty to be in a position from then on to testify first hand about these things in case there ever grew up at home the belief or assumption that `the stories of Nazi brutality were just propaganda’" indicative of Eisenhower presaging Holocaust denial? Was Eisenhower specifically ever confronted with the reality of Holocaust denial? Why was he so worried about it initially?


5. Are there any specific documentation of impacts, military or civilian correspondence in terms of impact on Jewish soldiers following the liberation of the camps?

6. Finally, is the onset of Holocaust denial in the decades following the end of the war at all attributable to the lack of public awareness in regards to the Nazi genocide apparatus? Could a more systemic public presentation of available information have curtailed it? Or rather was Holocaust denial an inevitable movement that would spring from Nazi apologism and historical revision? This is tied to the original question.



I\'m sorry if I included too many sub-questions... This is my first post on this sub and I didn\'t see any rules about sub-questions so I just went ahead and included them. I posted this because I\'ve just finished Eisenhower\'s book and this part stuck out to me specifically because it seemed he, as the Supreme Allied Commander of the ETO was extremely cautious of Holocaust denial, even at the time and would have been in a unique position to push for official documentation. I read through the /r/askhistorians threads about Holocaust denial but couldn\'t really find anything specific about Eisenhower and the specific actions he took in regards to it. I\'m further curious as to what institutional measures were taken to enshrine the historicity of the Holocaust and if allied and post-war leaders other than Ike considered this of paramount importance and what he specifically did to follow through with his stated intentions in *Crusade in Europe*.


**EDIT**: I\'ve edited this post a lot to more clarify and specify the questions I had in mind so I apologise if that causes any confusion in the answers.

The proposal we produced was a (very) solid one, but AskHistorians is such a new beast in the historical scene we thought it would likely be rejected (hence no announcement). “But wouldn’t it be cool to try?”

The proposal was accepted in every regard. 

The good news? Hey, we\'re famous! The great news? It\'s thanks to each and every one of you. We\'re the largest and most heavily trafficked history forum in the world, bar none. Now we’re going to strut our stuff at one of the largest and most heavily trafficked traditional history spaces.

The event will be from January 7-10 in Atlanta, GA. We are currently looking into having our presentations recorded (in a way we can distribute on multiple platforms) so that everyone will be able to watch the panel and see how it goes. We will also be posting the presentation abstracts in their own post shortly. 

Since acceptance, we\'ve been running around behind the scenes on top of our normal moderating to get everything together. There is about 4 months until the event, and our last hurdle is funding. We\'ve been working with the Reddit admins, who we cannot thank enough; they have been supportive and positive throughout. **Reddit, Inc. has generously agreed to cover half of our projected expenses, and have given us the go-ahead to crowdfund the remainder.** Which is where you come in! 

**This presentation is entirely about AskHistorians as a community and how it is reshaping public history. No one is presenting on their own personal historical work.** This is not really about us, it will be about you. We’re excited about heading to the world’s largest historical conference, but we’re going to Atlanta to represent you and we take that seriously. None of us are presenting within our “field” - it is entirely about AskHistorians. We really think something special is happening here, something that hasn’t been replicated anywhere else in academic history or in traditional public history venues like museums or documentaries. We’ve all together flipped the traditional method of transmitting history on its head. Normally an exhibit or a book or blog post is just thrown out and people hope to find an interested audience. Here, the audience itself starts the historical conversation and the experts respond to that. We’d like to tell other historians, other humanities fields, and more people who could be part of our community, about what we’re doing. 

**We are not the “ivory tower academics” that usually present at conferences.** Two of our panelists are currently affiliated with universities and are applying for grants with their schools. Our other three are the most disadvantaged animal in academia - “independent scholars.” They have no access to university funding that usually sends people to conferences, and are ineligible for most external travel grants. It is projected that it will take about $7,600 total to send our 5 people to this conference. We come before you to apply for The People’s Grant.

Thanks again for everything from all of us, for reading, posting, upvoting, (judiciously) downvoting, and especially for submitting your questions. We hope that you\'re as excited as we are about this incredible opportunity for our community!',
            'html' => '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re thrilled to share some really big news! In January we were approached by the American Historical Association (AHA) to submit ideas for a panel about AskHistorians. The proposal we produced was a (very) solid one, but AskHistorians is such a new beast in the historical scene we thought it would likely be rejected (hence no announcement). “But wouldn’t it be cool to try?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal was accepted in every regard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news? Hey, we&amp;#39;re famous! The great news? It&amp;#39;s thanks to each and every one of you. We&amp;#39;re the largest and most heavily trafficked history forum in the world, bar none. Now we’re going to strut our stuff at one of the largest and most heavily trafficked traditional history spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event will be from January 7-10 in Atlanta, GA. We are currently looking into having our presentations recorded (in a way we can distribute on multiple platforms) so that everyone will be able to watch the panel and see how it goes. We will also be posting the presentation abstracts in their own post shortly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since acceptance, we&amp;#39;ve been running around behind the scenes on top of our normal moderating to get everything together. There is about 4 months until the event, and our last hurdle is funding. We&amp;#39;ve been working with the Reddit admins, who we cannot thank enough; they have been supportive and positive throughout. &lt;strong&gt;Reddit, Inc. has generously agreed to cover half of our projected expenses, and have given us the go-ahead to crowdfund the remainder.&lt;/strong&gt; Which is where you come in! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This presentation is entirely about AskHistorians as a community and how it is reshaping public history. No one is presenting on their own personal historical work.&lt;/strong&gt; This is not really about us, it will be about you. We’re excited about heading to the world’s largest historical conference, but we’re going to Atlanta to represent you and we take that seriously.

“*The children will go bathing*” is what the Nazi officer said to Dounia W. after she arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau with her two kids in 1943. Her children did not go bathing. Instead, they were forced together with other children and old people into the gas chamber, where they died a gruesome death. Dounia, on the other hand, was brought into the camp as a forced laborer. Because she spoke Polish, Russian, and German, she was able to survive as a translator and tell the story, of how she was separated from her children and how she realized she would never see them again, at the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial after the war.

Sessions of this and similar trials are full examples like this, which is one of many such stories historians of Nazi Germany and other eras in history encounter regularly in their work. The cruelty of both individuals and regimes that forcibly separate children from their parents, detain and imprison people they regard as "alien" or "unworthy" under horrible circumstances, force people into slavery, and commit atrocities and genocide.

“*Is such a thing possible today?*” and “*How was it possible back then?”* are frequent questions, and the answer for the historian both regarding the cruelty of individuals and the cruelty of state policy often lies in larger social and political processes, rather than solely individuals, psychopathology or something similar. The descend into cruelty and abhorrent deeds is one that in almost all historical situations is not caused by one individual\'s personal cruelty but by a socially and political accepted mindset of necessity and acceptance of cruelty.

A central tenet of historians dealing with cruelty is that there is always a larger social, ideological, and political dimension to it.

Nazi Germany will be the example I use but the same methods and ideas can be applied to other eras and examples in history and since the early ‘90s, historiography has shifted focus strongly to the perpetrators and their motives for killing and cruelty. Christopher Browning is one such prominent example, but another researcher who has had a large impact in studying this topic is the social-psychologist Harald Welzer.

“*Abolish certain established rationalities and establish new ones*” is how Welzer describes one of the most central processes pursued by the Nazi regime. Exploring the issue in his book “*Täter. Wie aus ganz normalen Menschen Massenmörder werden*” (Perpetrators. How normal people become Massmurderers), he starts off with the psychological evaluations of the main perpetrators indicted in Nuremberg. These tests by the official court psychologists as well as further studies undertaken by George Kren and Leon Rappoport (who evaluated SS-members) could not find a higher percentage of psychopaths and sociopaths among the perpetrators of the Holocaust than are usually assumed to be in any general population. These men weren\'t psychologically abnormal. Their process of justification was rather quite "rational" in a sense.

“*Ice cold killers brought to explain their deeds, assumed that their actions were plausible – as plausible in fact as they had been in 1941 and onward when they killed thousands of people*”, describes Welzer. They were able to integrate mass killing and other horrible deeds into their perception of normality. They had been able to make these actions part of their normative orientation, their values, and what they identified as acceptable in interpersonal interactions.

In his explanations for why this was possible, Welzer uses Erving Goffman\'s concept of frame analysis as way to explain individual actions. Goffman\'s idea holds that an individual tries to principally act in a way that\'s right, meaning that they want to emerge from a situation according to their perceptions and interpretations if possible without damage and with a certain profit. What influences their perception of what constitutes "right", "no damage" and so forth is however something that depends on the framing of the actions and the situations. These frames are the connecting nodes between larger ideas and concrete actions; they contain ideas about how the world works, how humans are, and what one can do and must not do. In that they are similar to Bourdieu\'s Habitus term and they are deeply influenced by our surroundings. Examples for such frames could be the kind of upbringing a person has enjoyed, f.ex. if they grew up in a religious household. Other such frames can stem from the education an individual enjoyed, but crucially, frames of reference for our behavior are formed and provided by the society and the institutions around us.
Welzer uses the example of a surgeon to exemplify this: A surgeon is a person who, speaking on some level, horribly injures another person. They literally cut another person open with a very sharp knife. That an individual surgeon is able to do what they do and often use it as a point of pride is because they can rationalize and legitimize their actions with their outcome – lives being saved – and through their social framing. Cutting another person open with a sharp knife is what the surgeon is employed for – how the institution they work in frames their actions. This is why the surgeon can act with what Wlezer calls "professional detachment", meaning that they are on a psychological level able to detach themselves from the full reality of cutting another person open with a sharp knife and instead frame it as a step necessary to save a life.

Despite the vast gulf between a surgeon and a Nazi perpetrator, the underlying processes and the effects of framing work similarly: Countless recorded conversations between German soldiers in Allied POW camps reveal that these soldiers thought about their cruel deeds in similar ways: Tearing families apart, rape, killing hundreds of people, shipping people into camps and putting them in barracks and cages – they regarded these actions as legitimate. The frames they referenced were the necessity for security threatened by Jews and Partisans, their orders, flimsy legal justifications, standing with their comrades-in-arms.

In the protocols of a certain Feldwebel (Sergent) S., who was stationed first in the Soviet Union and then in France, S. argued that the Wehrmacht does have a “*legal right of revenge*” against the civilian population in case of Germans dying. S. sitting in Fort Hunt as POW explains his thinking to his comrades:

&gt;*Partisans need to be mowed down like every warfaring power has ever done. This is the law! We can only act energetically. (...) I have sworn myself, if we ever occupy France again, we must kill every male Frenchman between 14 and 60. Everyone of them I\'ll come across, I\'ll shot. That\'s what I am doing and that\'s what everyone of us should do.*

His friends agreed.

From the exchange between between the soldier Friedrich Held and Obergefreiter Walter Langfeld about the topic of anti-Partisan warfare:

&gt; H: Against Partisans, it is different. There, you look front and get shot in the back and then you turn around and get shot from the side. There simply is no Front.
&gt;
&gt; L: Yes, that\'s terrible. [...] But we did give them hell ["Wir haben sie ganz schön zur Sau gemacht"],
&gt;
&gt; H: Yeah, but we didn\'t get any. At most, we got their collaborators, the real Partisans, they shot themselves before they were captures. The collaborators, those we interrogated.
&gt;
&gt; L: But they too didn\'t get away alive.
&gt;
&gt; H: Naturally. And when they captured one of ours, they killed him too.
&gt;
&gt; L: You can\'t expect anything different. It\'s the usual [Wurscht ist Wurscht]
&gt;
&gt; H: But they were no soldiers but civilians.
&gt;
&gt; L: They fought for their homeland.
&gt;
&gt; H: But they were so deceitful...

The framing is clear here: The distinction between civilians and partisans is basically a moot point because of the deceitfulness of both of them and because they belong to a group that has been painted as *en gros dangerous*. That\'s how people like Held, Langfeld, and so many others could justify shooting women and children – the group they belonged to was dangerous by itself. “*That people weren\'t equal was evident to them*”, as Welzer writes.

Welzer further describes that Nazism even managed to incorporate an individual\'s struggle with their deeds into their frame of reference. They knew that what they were doing was immoral on some level but it was framed in a way where an individual who struggled with what they had to do and did it anyway was perceived as a "real man" because he would put the good of the people\'s community over his own feelings. Hence, when Himmler describes the Holocaust in his Posen speech, he highlights that despite the hard mission that had been given to them by history, they had always remained civilized (anständig). This is a particular nefarious aspect of these mechanism of ideological framing: Wherein overcoming doubt in the face of cruel acts becomes a virtue.

The transformation of a collective of individual\'s frame of reference doesn\'t happen overnight and encompasses a social process that is ideologically and politically driven.

It starts with things like newspaper articles about concentration camps in 1933 like [here](http://www.aachener-zeitung.de/polopoly_fs/1.502021.1359128036!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/zva_quer_540/image.jpg) in the Eschweiler Zeitung (a local paper) or [here](http://www.vulture-bookz.de/imagebank/Dokumente/images/1933-03-21~Bekanntmachung_KL_Dachau.jpg) in the Neueste Münchner Nachrichten, both hailing the opening of the Dachau Concentration Camp as the new method to combat those who threaten the German people and the cohesion of their nation while at the same time Jews, socialists and so forth were constantly described as criminals, rapists, and murderers and bringing violence to the German people\'s community.

It starts with fostering a general suspicion towards all members of certain groups. “*Where the Jew is, is the Partisan and where the Partisan is, is the Jew*”, wrote Nazi official Erich von dem Bach. The "Jew=Bolshevik=Partisan" calculus was a central instrument in framing the mass execution carried out by German soldiers as a defensive measure. To throw babies against walls to kill them, became in their minds an action of defense of the whole German people.

That these are in essence social and political process can also be shown with the very examples where the framing was broken by the public. When more and more details about the T4 killing programs of the mentally and physically handicapped emerged in Germany in 1941, public protests formed. Members of the Catholic Church opposed the program and said as much, Hitler was booed at a rally in Bavaria, and locals who lived near the killing centers, as well as families who had members killed, started writing letters – the regime was forced to walk back these measure, stop the centralized killing and instead continued on in secrecy and on a smaller scale.

Similarly in 1943 when the Jewish spouses of German men and women were arrested in Berlin and slated for deportation, their husbands and wives gathered in front of the prison in Rosenstraße and by way of this demonstration forced the Nazi Gauleiter of Berlin to release the arrested again. Far too seldom and few, these protests showed that a public can push back and break these kinds of frames if it can be activate to stand up against these injustices. Regimes that send people into camps, paint certain groups as an essential danger, and undermine the rule of law must depend more strongly on public support than regular democratic regimes ironically. All these things can only be done as long as there is the impression that a majority of the population stands behind them or, at least, won\'t do anything about it.

Hence, if there is a lesson to be learned from studying historic cruelty, it is that collective cruelty perpetrated by a state and its individual henchmen is a social process that can be disrupted if people start speaking up and demonstrating in the face of it. The current German constitution declares it not only legal but also a duty of every German citizen to resist a government and a regime that violates the principles of inviolable human dignity it enshrines in its first article – a lesson that the historic study of cruelty can only back up.',

&lt;p&gt;Hence, if there is a lesson to be learned from studying historic cruelty, it is that collective cruelty perpetrated by a state and its individual henchmen is a social process that can be disrupted if people start speaking up and demonstrating in the face of it. The current German constitution declares it not only legal but also a duty of every German citizen to resist a government and a regime that violates the principles of inviolable human dignity it enshrines in its first article – a lesson that the historic study of cruelty can only back up.&lt;/p&gt;

------------

I don\'t think I\'m making a leap by asserting that these kinds of sentiments are no longer common (except among the extremely inebriated). Yet, they\'re not rare at all in the history of letters -- men would write *super* emotional, sentimental letters to their best friends, certainly in the 19th century but also before. I know that it was also common for good friends to share the same bed (Ben Franklin and John Adams), hold hands, and even sit on each other\'s laps to display affection. 

So what exactly changed in the West between the 19th century and the 21st century that made male friendship so much more restrictive?',

Is he simply one of the very talented artists produced by Italy in the period, but not one of the \'absolute greats\'?

Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo... those three I think of as titans of Renaissance art, and I can picture or name examples of their work, and have a general sense of their influence. Donatello though, even after Googling for what his famous works are, I still don&amp;#39;t recognize any of them! When plumbing the depths of my knowledge, he is a Ninja Turtle, while the other three are artists who happen to &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be Ninja Turtles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you were making a &amp;#39;Big Four&amp;#39; of Renaissance artists, is he really such an odd-man out as my impression dictates? Is he simply one of the very talented artists produced by Italy in the period, but not one of the &amp;#39;absolute greats&amp;#39;? Or is he just as much of a master as the other three immortalized in  Testudic form, but unfortunately not as well remembered by the general public these days (and if the latter, why did he get comparatively forgotten?)?&lt;/p&gt;

sculpting is my hobby and I want to pick a historical topic for my next bust: Antigonus I.

I\'m currently doing my research and I\'m struggling. Alexander seems to be very well documented but learning more about the Diadochi/Antigonus is more difficult. Here are my main questions:

The person:

Antigonus died at the age of 81 so I\'ll probably just pick a random picture of an old Greek man and go from there. He lost an eye to an arrow, so I\'ll remove an eye and add scars. Is there anything else we know about his appearance? 

A big one is the beard: Alexander made his army shave and on sculptures/coins I found Antigonus is clean-shaven. Was he really clean shaven or he was just portrayed like that because of some agenda, like making him look similar to Alexander.  Do we have any information on the beard situation of Antigonus/the Diadochi after Alexander\'s death?

Equipment:

His equipment can\'t really be seen on the previously mentioned sculptures and coins but an article said that Oliver Stone\'s Alexander did a fairly good job with Macedonian military equipment. Is that true? Will my sculpture be more or less accurate if I copy Ian Beattie\'s equipment from the film? Is there something which changed between the time of Alexander\'s and Antigonus\' death&lt;?

Thanks in advance for any help!

I was looking through a Germanic Fechtbuch, &lt;a href="https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/B%C5%A9ech_von_fechter_Vnnd_Ringst%C3%BCckhen_z%C5%A9_Ross_vnnd_Fuo%C3%9F_(Cod.10799)"&gt;Codex 10799&lt;/a&gt;, and noticed a type of shield that I&amp;#39;ve never encountered before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Cod.10799_255r.jpg"&gt;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Cod.10799_255r.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Cod.10799_256r.jpg"&gt;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Cod.10799_256r.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Cod.10799_258r.jpg"&gt;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Cod.10799_258r.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have six to eight, others have ten, and one might even have TWELVE! What kind of shield is this, and are there any known surviving examples?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;if&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;you&amp;#39;re&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;feeling&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;deja&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vu&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;thats&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;normal&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

**Please Be Aware**: We expect everyone to read the rules and guidelines of this thread. Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don\'t include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.

Some questions people have just don\'t require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. 
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.

* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please Be Aware&lt;/strong&gt;: We expect everyone to read the rules and guidelines of this thread. Mods &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; remove answers which don&amp;#39;t include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some questions people have just don&amp;#39;t require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the ground rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Basically, in the novel a foreign noblewoman becomes an English duchess through a very profitable marriage. After the death of the husband however, she marries his squire and is denounced, losing her noble status and most of her fortune (from what I could understand). In spite of this, she\'s still widely referred as \'Dowager Duchess\' and still becomes lady-in-waiting for the queen, which I had thought was a position reserved for nobles of high standing.

So, my question is, should I have read her character as a tiny step above peasant, or rather as a peer of the realm? What were the actual consequences of \'marrying down\' for a woman in the XV century?',

Thank you in advance. 

Specifically:

1. Greer’s claim “he hated Indians” and the placing of responsibility of the Bengal famine squarely on his shoulders

2. Greer’s claim “he always advocated the most violent, the most destructive option. He used poison gas against the Kurds and Afghans”

3. Greer’s claim he was “a strong supporter” of the Boer War concentration camps

4. Seely’s claim he crossed the floor to support Chinese indentured workers in South Africa.

5. Seely’s claim he did many things that we now consider to help build the foundation of the welfare state. 

6. Morgan’s claim that cabinet papers show Churchill asked for “every effort to be made, even by diversion of shipping urgently needed for war purposes to deal with local shortages in India” (+ letters to Canada, Australia and the US asking for aid over the next two years)

7. Greer’s claim that Churchill refused Australian wheat ships in dock at Calcutta. “he destroyed 46,000 boats. He let that famine happen”

8. Greer’s claim Churchill refused to provide anti-aircraft ammunition to Clyde Bank because “he hated the workers and hated the trade unions”

Yuan Dynasty: Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong "colonial" coloration. The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule. The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century. In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate. Later the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the Yuan dynasty. In response to an objection against the use of "barbarians" in his government, the Yongle Emperor answered: "... Discrimination was used by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty, who employed only "Mongols and Tartars" and discarded northern and southern Chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them".

The Mongols had employed foreigners long before the reign of Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty. But during Kublai\'s reign a hierarchy of reliability was introduced in China. The population was divided into the following classes:

1. Mongols
2. Semu, consisting of non-Mongol foreigners from the west and Central Asia, like Buddhist Uyghurs from Turfan, Jews, Nestorian Christians, and Muslims from Central Asia
3. "Han", or all subjects of the former Jin dynasty, including Hans, Khitans, Jurchens in northern China, and other peoples like Koreans,
4. Southerners, or all subjects of the former Southern Song dynasty, including Hans and minority native ethnic groups in southern China, sometimes called "Manzi" during the Yuan

She’s looking for countries, city-states, or colonies that would fit roughly into the following scenario (she can change the scenario a bit to keep things accurate).

&gt; King of PLACE A wants to create a new trade route.
&gt; He is advised against his proposed route because there is conflict/tension between his neighboring PLACE B and PLACE C.
&gt; PLACE B has formed a secret alliance with PLACE D, so since the &gt; trade route would bring wealth to PLACE C, the allied B and D would sabotage such a route.

&gt; The king of PLACE A should instead create his trade route through the peaceful region of PLACE E.

Anything that somewhat fits that mold or a similar set of circumstances would be SO helpful.  The places can be in the Mediterranean or beyond it but close enough to still impact the Mediterranean.

Some say that Masada was held by Jewish zealots making a last stand against the Romans. Other sources say that Masada was in fact held by the Sicarii, who were bandits that preyed on Jews and Romans alike.

Then there’s confusion about what happened. I understand Josephus says that the people committed suicide rather than be enslaved. But some archaeologists say there is no evidence of suicide, in fact, there may not have been a siege at all. Some say Flavius Silva first built a wall around Masada and then built a ramp to the top and rolled a siege tower with a battering ram up the ramp. Others say the idea is ridiculous, no siege tower could have gone up that ramp, it’s barely wide enough for one man to walk on.

It’s very frustrating because they’re arguing even about the most basic facts: who was there, what was their fate?

Is there any scholarly consensus on what happened at Masada in 73 AD? Which facts have been well-established and are not controversial, if any?

        'html' => '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently saw the &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081900/"&gt;old TV miniseries&lt;/a&gt; about the Siege of Masada in 73 AD, which encouraged me to do some follow-up reading. But I found varying reports that are quite confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say that Masada was held by Jewish zealots making a last stand against the Romans. Other sources say that Masada was in fact held by the Sicarii, who were bandits that preyed on Jews and Romans alike.&lt;/p&gt;

I read that Prime Minister Shinzō Abe was a member of a Japanese ultra-nationalistic textbook revisionist group called Nippon Kaigi, and also that he denies any force or coercion was used upon the "comfort women." It is my understanding the the Japanese population as a whole is not as familiar with the atrocities committed by the Imperial military as one might expect. In Germany, it seems that the Holocaust is fairly well understood and condemned by the general public. It would be ludicrous for a Holocaust denialist to be elected Chancellor, wouldn\'t it?

What is the cause of the discrepancy between German and Japanese attitudes towards national atrocities? (Is there even a discrepancy at all, or am I mistaken?) One could probably look at attitudes all around the world towards past national atrocities, but I\'m more interested in Germany and Japan specifically right now. Thank you.',

&lt;p&gt;I read that Prime Minister Shinzō Abe was a member of a Japanese ultra-nationalistic textbook revisionist group called Nippon Kaigi, and also that he denies any force or coercion was used upon the &amp;quot;comfort women.&amp;quot; It is my understanding the the Japanese population as a whole is not as familiar with the atrocities committed by the Imperial military as one might expect. In Germany, it seems that the Holocaust is fairly well understood and condemned by the general public. It would be ludicrous for a Holocaust denialist to be elected Chancellor, wouldn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;

        'html' => '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m rephrasing a previous question to make it less hypothetical or speculative. I’m just curious about how Britain’s legal authority over its Caribbean colonies in the 1830’s differed from the authority it had over the pre-US colonies before US independence. Clearly, the British government was able to unilaterally abolish slavery in the Caribbean in the 1830’s.

The German advance through the Ardennes and the subsequent rush to the channel resulted in the encirclement of 61 Allied divisions. The Dunkirk Evacuation saw the rescue of ~330k Allied troops.

However, I\'m not a fully trained historian. I took college courses, but never completed a degree in the major. That being said, I don\'t know if I can spot the issues that the rest of you would be able to notice.

Were there people who were worried it would erode individual skill and artistry in kitchen and turn cooking into more science than art?&lt;/p&gt;

My questions are:

* Were american slaves actually given some sort of coca drug to make them work harder?
* When was cocaine made illegal? To my understanding it was an ingredient in a lot of medicines (and even *Coca* Cola) well after emancipation.
* Do you think that penal slavery was an intentional loophole for owning slaves, or simply a quirky cost-saving measure for our justice system, like bail or parole? Is there any record of debate around this topic at the time that would lend to his theory?

Much of our understanding of historical empires comes from written records. So, how do we know that huge, Persia-sized empires didn\'t exist in prehistory? For the thousands—actually, tens of thousands of years before history, there\'s an enormous trove of archaeological, linguistic, and genetic information about human mass migrations. One late example is the [Indo-European migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_migrations). Usually, these are explained as simple diffusion and not imperial conquest, but in the absence of writing, how can we know for sure that we\'re right?

My first thought was that "empires can\'t exist without writing", but apparently there are many counterexamples to this. One is the Inca Empire. It had [other methods of record-keeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu), so it didn\'t need writing. If we didn\'t have contemporaneous written records from the Spanish, I suspect there would be debate about whether the Incas really had an empire; many would just say they underwent a minor migration.

In Mr. Gatto\'s work, "The Underground History of American Education", he references Prussian schooling of the 19th century saying, "At the top one half of 1% of the students attended, Akadamiensschulen, where as future policy makers, they learned to think strategically, contextually, in wholes; they learned complex processes, and useful knowledge, studied history, wrote copiously, argued often, read deeply, and mastered tasks of command." 

What books detail this sort of learning or pedagogical teaching, and how similar is it to say Jesuit pedagogical works such as ratio studiorum, or  Father Benedict Ashley\'s "The Art of Learning and Communication: An Introduction to the Liberal Arts" 

Also is there any current institutions such as Elite private high schools like Phillips exter, or elite liberal arts or degree based universities that implement this sort of teaching style.

I would like to know just how the hierarchy worked back in the day, and all the rights and obligations, freedoms and pressures of the peasant, merchant, bandit, homeless, and similar classes of society. The wikipedia article on feudalism is abhorrently useless. It just says that the supreme lord gave land to a vassal, and the vassal promised to give money and be available whenever the main guy calls, and in return, he can farm the land and its people, and he can call for help. 




That doesn\'t help much with understanding the little guy. I wanna know about the litttle guy and how society worked. You wake up one day as a peasant. What can you do? What are you forced to do? Can you rise up through the social ranks? What obligations do you have to anyone? Can you just leave everything and go live in the forest? Was there police and bureaucrats? All these questions..



1. Were farmers slaves, or did they have to give a certain percentage of crops each year?  
2. Did they give the taxes individually per household or as a whole village?  
3. I understand there were free people such as merchants, how do you become free?  
4. Were there beggars and poor people, or were they disposed of, if they didn\'t contribute in some way to the economy?  
5. How were soldiers selected, and did you have to go, or was it voluntary?   
6. If you didn\'t want to pay taxes, could you go live in the forest somewhere? Or was it the lords forest, and whatever you do on his land, you gotta pay for it? (I vaguely remember someone getting in trouble for killing a deer in some lords forest or sometihng)
7. were more people merchants or farmers? the three brothers were all merchants, no?  
8. How was farming land alotted to the farmers? Was the land beside their house, or do they just go out and find some land so they can pay property tax?



9. What is the logic behind it all? If you farm natural resources, you gotta pay tax, but if you are a merchant or a you don\'t? What was tax based on? Property or income? (What about hidden income? What if the farmers farmed 100 carrots, but said they farmed only 60?)



Just try to explain to me the chinese feudal system from the view of the little guys.

Worth noting that he is not saying this was a democratic utopia and he points to the way large sections of urban society were excluded from this, as well as the countryside writ large, but it is more part of his argument about the development of modern European states. To give a direct quote, apologies for the length:

&gt;It will be enough for me to say that round about the tenth and eleventh centuries the whole of Europe appeared to be moving towards the constitution of those barbarian kingdoms, similar to the ones found today in the heart of Africa, or those of theocracies one knows about from Oriental history. This could not happen in a day; but the seeds of those petty royalties and for those petty theocracies were already there and were increasingly manifesting themselves.

&gt;Fortunately the ‘barbarian’ spirit - Scandinavian, Saxon, Celt, German Slav - which for seven or eight centuries had incited men to seek the satisfaction of their needs through individual initiative and through free agreement between the brotherhoods and guilds - fortunately that spirit persisted in the villages and boroughs. The barbarians allowed themselves to be enslaved, they worked for the master, but their feeling for free action and free agreement had not yet been broken down. Their brotherhoods were more alive than ever, and the crusades had only succeeded in arousing and developing them in the West.

&gt;**And so the revolution of the urban communities, resulting from the union of the village community and the sworn brotherhood of the artisans and the merchant - which had been prepared long since by the federal mood of the period - exploded in the eleventh and twelfth centuries with striking effect in Europe. It had already started in the Italian communities in the tenth century...**

&gt;In many regions it many regions it was a peaceful development. Elsewhere - and this applied in general to Western Europe - it was the result of a revolution. As soon as the inhabitants of a particular borough felt themselves to be sufficiently protected by their walls, they made a ‘conjuration’. They mutually swore an oath to drop all pending matters concerning slander, violence or wounding, and undertook, so far as disputes that might arise in the future, never again to have recourse to any judge other than the syndics which they themselves would nominate. In every good-neighborly or art guild, in every sworn brotherhood, it had been normal practice for a long time. In every village community, such as had been the way of life in the past, before the bishop and the petty king had managed to introduce, and later impose on it, its judge.

&gt;Now, the hamlets and parishes which made up the borough, as well as the guilds and brotherhoods which developed within it, looked upon themselves as a single amitas, nominated their judges and swore permanent union between all those groups.

&gt;A charter was soon drawn up and accepted. If need be, someone would be sent off to copy the charter of some neighboring small community (we know of hundreds of such charters) and the community was set up. The bishop or the prince, who had been until then the judge in the community, and often more or less its master, could in the circumstances only recognize the fait accompli - or oppose the new conjuration by force of arms. Often the king - that is the prince who sought to be a cut above the other princes and whose coffers were always empty - would ‘grant’ the charter for ready cash. Thus he refrained from imposing his judge on the community, while at the same time gaining prestige in the eyes of the other feudal lords. But this was by no means the rule; hundreds of communes remained active with no other authority than their goodwill, their ramparts and their lances.

Leaving aside the orientalism and whiff of ethnic essentialism (which I swear is less racist in context), can this sort of movement be detected?

Also, can this be connected to what I have read about a "refeudalization" in the seventeenth century (which relates to what Kropotkin talks about later in the piece)?',

I\'m not entirely sure how to get at what I\'m asking, so I\'ll try to break it into a few concise questions:

* How did pop culture manifest in post-civil war America? Novels? Oratory? Opera?
* Are there any examples of the sort of post-war decompressing that come to mind in the wake of the Civil War?
* Are there any historians already dealing with this type of subject matter (not necessarily post civil-war)? I\'m sure there must be. Any recommendations?
* Although I\'m specifically asking about post Civil War in America, I\'m curious about and would welcome discussions about other countries and how wars or other such large scale events were reflected in their cultures.

&gt;There has been a prolonged and often bitter debate among historians over the economics of North American slavery.

I\'m curious to see if there\'s any historical consensus on this topic. Was the per capita income in the South not declining until the end of the war? Was slavery at no risk of "dying out" due to being uncompetitive?

        'text' => 'This might be an obscure one. A popular Irish rebellion song refers to the uniform hat of the IRA as a "broad black brimmer." Now, the hat, known alternatively as a "Slouch hat," "Beor Hat," or "Bush Hat," became associated with the IRA. My question is thus: Why do they sing of a "Broad Black Brimmer," and why is the hat named specifically "Black?" All of the research I\'ve done, and all the reproductions I\'ve seen, show the hat as "dark green, to match the uniform." I had a few thoughts to this, but they are theories and I need facts. Here\'s what I know:

1. The song refers to the IRA specifically, when the hat was actually associated with the Irish Volunteers. This may just be an artistic simplification, since within 7 years of their founding the Irish Volunteers became the IRA and quite possibly kept their uniform. I have seen Irish War of Independence era IRA official uniforms that look more like a proper military uniform though, including a flat topper military cap, as opposed to the rounded or creased slouch hat.

2. The uniform of both the IRA and the Irish Volunteers wasn\'t cheap, especially at a time many revolutionaries were very poor. I\'ve seen written that between 1/4 and 1/3 of the volunteers could afford a full uniform, and many simply wore a hat and/or pin. Perhaps the black hats were cheaper and more common than the official uniform ones? Since the song mentions a "Sam Brown belt," which also wasn\'t cheap, maybe black hats denoted an officer? 

3. The cover to the album of "The Wolfe Tones," (a prolific Irish rebel band) called "Rifles of the IRA shows them wearing the uniform described in the song with greenish-grey hats. I find it likely, or at least plausible, that such an old band (many of them were born in the 1940s) immersed in Irish rebel tradition would have the right of it for the uniform. 

Any information, including sources please if possible, would be greatly appreciated.',
        'html' => '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might be an obscure one. A popular Irish rebellion song refers to the uniform hat of the IRA as a &amp;quot;broad black brimmer.&amp;quot; Now, the hat, known alternatively as a &amp;quot;Slouch hat,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Beor Hat,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Bush Hat,&amp;quot; became associated with the IRA. My question is thus: Why do they sing of a &amp;quot;Broad Black Brimmer,&amp;quot; and why is the hat named specifically &amp;quot;Black?&amp;quot; All of the research I&amp;#39;ve done, and all the reproductions I&amp;#39;ve seen, show the hat as &amp;quot;dark green, to match the uniform.&amp;quot; I had a few thoughts to this, but they are theories and I need facts. Here&amp;#39;s what I know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The song refers to the IRA specifically, when the hat was actually associated with the Irish Volunteers. This may just be an artistic simplification, since within 7 years of their founding the Irish Volunteers became the IRA and quite possibly kept their uniform. I have seen Irish War of Independence era IRA official uniforms that look more like a proper military uniform though, including a flat topper military cap, as opposed to the rounded or creased slouch hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I am wondering what were the foundations of the relationship between Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. I know that Ger and the A-H Emp. tried to support the Ott Emp. claim during the London Treaty of 1913, to strengthen them against the winning Balkan League.

How did the relationship between these 3 nations start. Why was it important to the two European nations to strengthen the claim of this Middle-Eastern power in the Balkans?

I am quite puzzled by it, even more why the A-H Emp. would support the Ott Emp. as historically they almost got overrun by their armies a century before, and they probably experienced the harsh treatment of occupied nations by the Ott army themselves.',

I\'d imagine being conquered by the man who made the first ever known declaration of human rights would result in some complications and I\'m especially interested in how the Babylonians reacted when Cyrus famously freed their captive Jewish population. So how did they react? What were some of said complications? And if anyone has enough time on their hands, what about some of the other places still practicing slavery? 


2) For the areas of the empire where slavery was successfully abolished or was never all that widespread in the first place, who were the farmers if not the slaves? 


3) How did the Greeks view Cyrus during and/or after his rule? 


Thank you to anyone who answers any one of the questions in advance.

'text' => 'In looking through the historical theory syllabi online, a core of books tend to appear pretty often -- Collingwood\'s "Idea of History", Evans\'s "In Defence of History", Carr\'s "What is History?", Tosh\'s "The Pursuit of History", Novick\'s "That Noble Dream", Bloch\'s "The Historian\'s Craft", and so on.

My question is: How often do you find yourself citing theoretical or "methods" works like these in your actual work as a historian?

Do historiographical writings mostly work as an implicit influence (sitting in the back of the historian\'s consciousness, so to speak), or are texts on methods explicitly invoked as authorities in historical arguments?',

Q1. How then, was the army transformed into a capable force within a few decades after the 30 years war?

Q2. In particular how did the centre assert its authority over the feudatories, since in my understanding any other change (such as creating a professional, meritocratic officer corps) could not have succeeded without this?

'text' => 'I\'m talking about the type of swordplay seen in [this clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehFKmYOueZs) from *Macbeth*, the "high guard" slashing seen in [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv5E74k4DaY) from *Kingdom of Heaven*, and so on.

I\'ve read (in apparently reliable sources like [this article](https://swordscholar.com/medieval-sword-fighting-techniques/)) that actual medieval broadsword fighting was much more focused on lunges and thrusts, intended to get the tip of the blade inside the enemy\'s armor and inflict a wound as quickly as possible.

My question isn\'t "Did experienced medieval knights fence with more speed and skill than modern stuntmen," because the answer to that is obviously "yes." 

I\'m more asking whether the type of hack-and-slash fighting we see in movies ever **was** practiced in the medieval period — say, for showboating at tournaments, maybe — or if just it\'s a flat-out fabrication of modern filmmakers.

I&amp;#39;m wondering whether someone planning to travel long distances in their own carriage would somehow have to have their own horses stationed along the way, (and if so, would they just keep them there indefinitely in case they needed them?) and if not, what other arrangements would be likely? Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;

As the books I read are mostly about Soviet period, it raises the question about &lt;em&gt;how open are and what has changed in the Russian archives since 1991?&lt;/em&gt; I have heard many times that Russian archives were opened up in 1991, but then it gradually got closed down. In February 2018, Anthony Beevor wrote this for an article in The Guardian - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;,,Most Russian archives, especially the military ones, were closed to foreign historians back in 2000 after the tantalising glimpses we had enjoyed from 1992.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For reference I’m interested in Western Europe and I’ve been looking at artwork from the 1300s to 1400s. I’m hoping for information on what would today be thought of as middle class women. Someone who would have plenty to eat and people to help with housework, though not completely divorced from having to do physical work around the house. 

As best I can tell it would be a linen chemise or long tunic against the skin with stockings. Then over that another long tunic or kirtle/gown. Then if they needed extra dress protection or warmth a surcoat that would either be tied or sewed closed on the sides. Married women would be veiled with the hair entirely or mostly hidden. 

But what about belts? Above or below the surcoat? Would women add an apron on over the surcoat if they were going to do something exceptionally dirty, or was the surcoat the apron? How did bust support work? As best I can tell from old paintings the bodice either didn’t exist or was worn under the main gown so was that a part of undergarments or did they use something else?

Thanks very much!',

&lt;p&gt;For reference I’m interested in Western Europe and I’ve been looking at artwork from the 1300s to 1400s. I’m hoping for information on what would today be thought of as middle class women. Someone who would have plenty to eat and people to help with housework, though not completely divorced from having to do physical work around the house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As best I can tell it would be a linen chemise or long tunic against the skin with stockings. Then over that another long tunic or kirtle/gown. Then if they needed extra dress protection or warmth a surcoat that would either be tied or sewed closed on the sides. Married women would be veiled with the hair entirely or mostly hidden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about belts? Above or below the surcoat? Would women add an apron on over the surcoat if they were going to do something exceptionally dirty, or was the surcoat the apron? How did bust support work? As best I can tell from old paintings the bodice either didn’t exist or was worn under the main gown so was that a part of undergarments or did they use something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much!&lt;/p&gt;

'text' => '"The Guardian" changes to "The Observer" on Sundays, "The Sun" used to become "News of the World". Most (if not all) British newspapers do this. The names often reflect the fact that they are the same newspaper (e.g. the "Daily Mail" becoming "The Mail on Sunday").

Essentially they are the same newspapers, so why do they take different names? Sure, they have different staff and different features, but so do the Saturday editions of papers, and those keep the name of their weekday counterpart.

How did this tradition arise?',

Thursday Reading and Recommendations is intended as bookish free-for-all, for the discussion and recommendation of all books historical, or tangentially so. Suggested topics include, but are by no means limited to:

* Asking for book recommendations on specific topics or periods of history

* Newly published books and articles you\'re dying to read

* Recent book releases, old book reviews, reading recommendations, or just talking about what you\'re reading now

* Historiographical discussions, debates, and disputes

* ...And so on!

Regular participants in the Thursday threads should just keep doing what they\'ve been doing; newcomers should take notice that this thread is meant for open discussion of history and books, not just anything you like -- we\'ll have a thread on Friday for that, as usual.

Anyways, from my understanding, there is no definite consensus on what factors led to the fall of the Weimar Republic and the Rise of the Nazi Party.

I\'m aware of perspectives such as Shirer\'s which suggests that Nazism was a logical phase in the development in Germany. He spends a lot of time talking about Hitler specifically but unless I\'m mistaken (which is likely) his main argument is that Germany was destined to have some sort of fascist authority.

**Please Be Aware**: We expect everyone to read the rules and guidelines of this thread. Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don\'t include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.

Some questions people have just don\'t require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. 
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.

* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don\'t realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.

* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are prefered. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the \'Oxford Companion\' series, or a reference work from an academic press).

* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it. All other rules of the subreddit are in force.

I read several references to this case, with some people claiming, that half a million children died throughout this period. 

It seems evident, that the Sanctions did have a devastating effect on the Iraqi economy and that even some medication was banned. However, I\'m questioning the sources, since I recently found an article that claims, that all the data about the death toll was manipulated by the Iraqi government. 

I don\'t really know, which side is using propaganda in this case. 

I previously found a report by the UN Human Rights Report on the Humanitarian situation in the Iraq, but I can\'t find it anymore. 

What do you think about the explanation given in this article?  Is it trustworthy?

This reminded me of the Alliterative Morte Arthure, especially the moment Arthur sees that Gawain has been slain. He cries, kisses his dead friend, swoons, cries some more, is told to get a grip on himself and swoons again. 

A much later example would be the Romance poets and authors, who are also very sensitive to strong emotions. Like the romance knights, they have to stay in control of their sorrow or happiness, but being easily overwhelmed is not seen as a bad thing.

Today, there are voices that call for (much needed) acceptance of men\'s emotionality, but it is still kind of taboo. I was wondering when and why this changed in western society.

                'text' => 'Welcome to Monday Methods!

Today\'s post will be a bit longer than previous posts because of the topic: Holocaust Denial and how to combat it.

It\'s a rather specific topic but in recent weeks, we have noticed a general uptick of Holocaust Denial and "JAQing" in this sub and with the apparently excellent movie [Denial](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4645330/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) coming out soon, we expect further interest.

We have previously and at length argued [why we don\'t allow Holocaust denial or any other forms of revisionism under our civility rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ijkk9/rules_roundtable_10_civility_and_debating_with/) but the reasons for doing so will – hopefully – also become more apparent in this post. At the same time, a post like this seemed necessary because we do get questions from people who don\'t ascribe to Holocaust Denial but have come in contact with their propaganda and talking points and want more information. As we understand this sub to have an educational mission and to be a space with the purpose of presenting informative, in-depth, and comprehensive information to people seeking it, we are necessarily dedicated to values such as the pursuit of of historical truth and imparting historical interpretations based on fact and good faith.

With all that in mind, it felt appropriate to create a post like this where we discuss what Holocaust Denial is, what its methods and background are, what information we have so far comprised on some of its most frequent talking point, and how to combat it further as well as invite our user to share their knowledge and perspective, ask questions, and discuss further. So, without further ado, let\'s dive into the topic.

# Part 1: Definitions

## What is the Holocaust?

As a starting point, it is important to define what is talked about here. Within the relevant scholarly literature and for the purpose of this post, the term Holocaust is defined as the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of approximately six million Jews and up to half a million Roma, Sinti, and other groups persecuted as "gypsies" by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. It took place at the same time as other atrocities and crimes such as the Nazis targeting other groups on grounds of their perceived "inferiority", like  the disabled and Slavs, and on grounds of their religion, ideology or behavior among them Communists, Socialists, Jehovah\'s Witnesses and homosexuals. During their 12-year reign, the conservative estimate of victims of Nazi oppression and murder numbers 11 million people, though newer studies put that number at somewhere between 15 and 20 million people.

## What is Holocaust Denial?

Holocaust Denial is the attempt and effort to negate, distort, and/or minimize and trivialize the established facts about the Nazi genocides against Jews, Roma, and others with the goal to rehabilitate Nazism as an ideology.

Because of the staggering numbers given above, the fact that the Nazi regime applied the tools at the disposal of the modern state to genocidal ends, their sheer brutality, and a variety of other factors, the ideology of Nazism and the broader historical phenomenon of Fascism in which Nazism is often placed, have become – rightfully so – politically tainted. As and ideology that is at its core racist, anti-Semitic, and genocidal, Nazism and Fascism have become politically discredited throughout most of the world.

Holocaust Deniers seek to remove this taint from the ideology of Nazism by distorting, ignoring, and misrepresenting historical fact and thereby make Nazism and Fascism socially acceptable again. In other words, Holocaust Denial is a form of political agitation in the service of bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism.

In his book *Lying about Hitler* Richard Evans summarizes the following points as the most frequently held beliefs of Holocaust Deniers:

&gt; (a) The number of Jews killed by the Nazis was far less than 6 million; it amounted to only a few hundred thousand, and was thus similar to, or less than, the number of German civilians killed in Allied bombing raids.
&gt;
&gt; (b) Gas chambers were not used to kill large numbers of Jews at any time.
&gt;
&gt; (c) Neither Hitler nor the Nazi leaderhsip in general had a program of exterminating Europe\'s Jews; all they wished to do was to deport them to Eastern Europe.
&gt;
&gt; (d) "The Holocaust" was a myth invented by Allied propaganda during the war and sustained since then by Jews who wished to use it for political and financial support for the state of Israel or for themselves. The supposed evidence for the Nazis\' wartime mass murder of millions of Jews by gassing and other means was fabricated after the war.

## Part 2: What are the methods of Holocaust Denial?

The methods of how Holocaust Deniers try to achieve their goal to distort, minimize, or outright deny historical fact vary. One thing though that needs to be stressed from the very start is that Holocaust Deniers are not legitimate historians. Historians engage in interpretation of historical events and phenomena based on the facts found in sources. Holocaust Deniers on the other hand seek to bend, obfuscate, and explain away facts to fight their politically motivated interpretation.

Since the late 70s and early 80s, Holocaust Deniers have sought to give themselves an air of legitimacy in the public eye. This includes copying the format and techniques used by legitimate historians and in that process label themselves not as deniers but as "revisionists". This is not a label they deserve. As Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman point out in their book *Denying History*:

&gt; Historians are the ones who should be described as revisionists. To receive a Ph.D. and become a professional historian, one must write an original work with research based on primary documents and new sources, reexamining or reinterpreting some historical event—in other words, revising knowledge about that event only. This is not to say, however, that revision is done for revision’s sake; it is done when new evidence or new interpretations call for a revision.
&gt;
&gt; Historians have revised and continue to revise what we know about the Holocaust. But their revision entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.
&gt;
&gt; Holocaust deniers claim that there is a force field of dogma around the Holocaust—set up and run by the Jews themselves—shielding it from any change. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whether or not the public is aware of the academic debates that take place in any field of study, Holocaust scholars discuss and argue over any number of points as research continues. Deniers do know this.

Rather, the Holocaust Deniers\' modus operandi is to use arguments based on half-truths, falsification of the historical record, and innuendo to misrepresent the historical record and sow doubt among their audience. They resort to fabricating evidence, the use of pseudo-academic argumentation, cherry-picking of sources, outrageous and not supported interpretation of sources, and emotional claims of far-reaching conspiracy masterminded by Jews.

Let me give you an example of how this works that is also used by Evans in *Lying about Hitler*, p. 78ff.: David Irving, probably one of the world\'s most prominent Holocaust Deniers, has argued for a long time that Hitler was not responsible for the Holocaust, even going so far as to claim that Hitler did not know about Jews being killed. This has been the central argument of his book *Hitler\'s War* published in 1977 and 1990 (with distinct differences, as in the 1990 edition going even further in its Holocaust Denial). In the 1977 edition on page 332, Irving writes that Himmler

&gt; was summoned to the Wolf\'s Lair for a secret conference with Hitler, at which the fate of Berlin\'s Jews was clearly raised. At 1.30 PM Himmler was obliged to telephone from Hitler\'s bunker to Heydrich the explicit order that Jews were *not to be liquidated* [Italics in the original]

Throughout the rest of the book in its 1977 edition and even more so in its 1990s edition, Iriving kept referring to Hitler\'s "November 1941 order forbidding the liquidation of Jews" and in his introduction to the book wrote that this was "incontrovertible evidence" that "Hitler ordered on November 30, 1941, that there was to be ‚no liquidation‘ of the Jews." [*Hitler\'s War*, 1977, p. xiv].

Let\'s look at what the phone log actually says. Kept in the German Bundesarchiv under the signature NS 19/1438, Telefonnotiz Himmler v. 30.11.1941:

&gt; Verhaftung Dr. Jekelius (Arrest of Dr. Jekelius)
&gt;
&gt; Angebl. Sohn Molotov; (Supposed son of Molotov)
&gt;
&gt; Judentransport aus Berlin. (Jew-transport from Berlin.)
&gt;
&gt; keine Liquidierung (no liquidation)

Richard Evans remarks about this [p. 79] that it is clear to him as well as any reasonable person reading this document that the order to not liquidate refers to one transport, not – as Irving contends – all Jews. This is a reasonable interpretation of this document backed up further when we apply basic historiographical methods as historians are taught to do.

On November 27, we know from documents by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (the national German railway), that there was indeed a deportation train of Berlin Jews to Riga. We know this, not just because the fact that this was a deportation train is backed up by the files of the Berlin Jewish community but because the Reichsbahn labels it as such and the Berlin Gestapo had given an order for it.

We also know that the order for no liquidation for this transport arrived too late. The same day as this telephone conversation took place, the Higher SS and Police Leader of Latvia, Friedrich Jeckeln, reported that the Ghetto of Riga had been cleared of Latvian Jews and also that about one thousand German Jews from this transport had been shot along with them. This lead to a lengthy correspondence between Jeckeln and Himmler with Himmler reprimanding Jeckeln for shooting the German Jews.

A few days earlier, on November 27, German Jews also had been shot in great numbers in Kaunas after having been deported there.

Furthermore, neither the timeline nor the logic asserted by Irving match up when it comes to this document. We know from Himmler\'s itinerary that he met Hitler after this phone conversation took place, not before as Irving asserts. Also, if Hitler – as Irving posits – was not aware of the murder of the Jews, how could he order their liquidation to be stopped?

Now, what can be gleaned from this example are how Holocaust Deniers like Irving operate:

* In his discussion and interpretation of the document, Irving takes one fragment of the document that fits his interpretation: "no liquidation".

* He leaves out another fragments preceding it that is crucial to understand the meaning of this phrase: "Jew-transport from Berlin."

* He does not place the document within the relevant historical context: That there was a transport from Berlin, whose passengers were not to be shot in contradiction to passengers of an earlier transport and to later acts of murder against German Jews.

* He lies about what little context he gave for the document: Himmler met Hitler after the telephone conversation rather than before.

* And based on all that, he puts forth a historical interpretation that while it does not match the historical facts, it matches his ideological conclusions: Hitler ordered the murder of Jews halted – a conclusion that does not even fit his logic that Hitler didn\'t know about the murder of Jews.

A reasonable and legitimate interpretation of this document and the ongoings surrounding it is put forth by Christian Gerlach in his book *Krieg, Ernährung, Völkermord*. p. 94f. Gerlach argues that the first mass shooting of German Jews on November 27, 1941 had caused fear among the Nazi leadership that details concerning the murder of German Jews might become public. In order to avoid a public outcry similar to that against the T4 killing program of the handicapped. For this reason, they needed more time to figure out what to do with the German Jews and arrived at the ultimate conclusion to kill them under greater secrecy in camps such as Maly Trostinecz and others.

## Part 3: How do I recognize  and combat Holocaust Denial

# Recognizing Denial

From the above given example, not only the methods of Holocaust Deniers become clear but also, that it can be very difficult for a person not familiar with the minutiae of the history of the Holocaust to engage or even recognize Holocaust Denial. This is exactly a fact, Holocaust Deniers are counting on when spreading their lies and propaganda.

So how can one as a lay person recognize Holocaust Denial?

Aside from an immediate red flag that should go up as soon as people start talking about Jewish conspiracies, winner\'s justice, and supposed "truth" suppressed by the mainstream, any of the four points mentioned about Holocaust Denier\'s beliefs above should also ring alarm bells immediately.

Additionally, there is a number of authors and organizations that are well known as Holocaust Deniers. Reading their names or them being quoted in an affirmative manner are also sure fire signs of Holocaust Denial. The authors and organizations include but are not limited to: The Institute for Historical Review, the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust, David Irving, Arthur Butz, Paul Rassinier, Fred Leuchter, Ernst Zündel, and William Carto.

Aside all these, anti-Semitic and racist rhetoric are an integral part of almost all Holocaust Denial literature. I previously mentioned the Jewish conspiracy trope but when you suddenly find racist, anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, and white supremacists rhetoric in a media that otherwise projects historical reliability it is a sign that it is a Holocaust Denier publication.

Similarly, there are are certain argumentative strategies Holocaust Deniers use. Next to the obvious of trying to minimize the numbers of people killed et. al., these include casting doubt on eyewitness testimony while relying on eyewitness testimony that helps their position, asserting that post-war confessions of Nazis were forced by torture, or some numbers magic that might seem legit at first but becomes really unconvincing once you take a closer look at it.

In short, recognizing Holocaust Denial can be achieved the best way if one approaches it like one should approach many things read: By engaging its content and assertions critically and by taking a closer look at the arguments presented and how they are presented. If someone like Irving writes that Hitler didn\'t know about the Holocaust, yet ordered it stopped in 1941, as a reader one should quickly arrive at the conclusion that he has some explaining to do.

# How do we combat Holocaust Denial

Given how Holocaust denial is part of a political agenda pandering bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism, combating it needs to take into account this context and any effective fight against Holocaust Denial needs to be a general fight against bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism.

At the same time, it is important to know that the most effective way of fighting them and their agenda is by engaging their arguments rather than them. This is important because any debate with a Holocaust Denier is a debate not taking place on the same level. As Deborah Lipstadt once wrote: "[T]hey are contemptuous of the very tools that shape any honest debate: truth and reason. Debating them would be like trying to nail a glob of jelly to the wall. (...) We must educate the broader public and academe about this threat and its historical and ideological roots. We must expose these people for what they are."

In essence, someone who for ideological reasons rejects the validity of established facts is someone with whom direct debates will never bear any constructive fruits. Because when you do not even share a premise – that facts are facts – arguing indeed becomes like nailing a pudding to the wall.

So, what can we do? 

Educate ourselves, educate others, and expose Holocaust Deniers as the racist, bigots and anti-Semites they are. There is a good reason Nazism is not socially acceptable as an ideology – and there is good reason it should stay that way. Because it is wrong in its very essence. The same way Holocaust Denial is wrong at its very core. Morally as well as simply factually.

Thankfully, there are scores of resources out there, where anybody interested is able to educate and inform themselves. The [United States Holocaust Memorial Museum](https://www.ushmm.org/) has resources as well as a whole encyclopedia dedicated to spread information about the Holocaust. Emory University Digital Resource Center has its [The Holocaust on Trial Website](https://www.hdot.org/) directly addressing many of the myths and lies spread by Holocaust Deniers and providing a collection of material used in the Irving v. Lipstadt trial. The [Jewish Virtual Library](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/denial1.html) as well as the – somewhat 90s in their aesthetics – [Nizkor Project](http://www.nizkor.org/) also provide easily accessible online resources to inform oneself about claims of Holocaust Deniers. (And there is us too! Doing our best to answer the questions you have!)

Another very important part of fighting Holocaust Denial is to reject the notion that this is a story "that has two sides". This is often used to give these people a forum or argue that they should be able to somehow present their views to the public. It is imperative to not walk into this fallacious trap. There are no two sides to one story here. There are people engaging in the serious study of history who try to find a variety of perspectives and interpretation based on facts conveyed to us through sources. And then there are Holocaust Deniers who use lies, distortion, and the charge of conspiracy. These are not two sides of a conversation with equal or even slightly skewed legitimacy. This is people engaging in serious conversations and arguments vs. people whose whole argument boils down to "nuh-uh", "it\'s that way because of the Jews" and "lalalala I can\'t hear you". When one "side" rejects facts en gros not because they can disprove them, not because they can argue that they aren\'t relevant or valid but rather because they don\'t fit their bigoted world-view, they cease to be a legitimate side in a conversation and become the equivalent of a drunk person yelling "No, you!" but in a slightly more sophisticated and much more nefarious way.

                'html' => '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Monday Methods!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s post will be a bit longer than previous posts because of the topic: Holocaust Denial and how to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a rather specific topic but in recent weeks, we have noticed a general uptick of Holocaust Denial and &amp;quot;JAQing&amp;quot; in this sub and with the apparently excellent movie &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4645330/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"&gt;Denial&lt;/a&gt; coming out soon, we expect further interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have previously and at length argued &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ijkk9/rules_roundtable_10_civility_and_debating_with/"&gt;why we don&amp;#39;t allow Holocaust denial or any other forms of revisionism under our civility rule&lt;/a&gt; but the reasons for doing so will – hopefully – also become more apparent in this post. At the same time, a post like this seemed necessary because we do get questions from people who don&amp;#39;t ascribe to Holocaust Denial but have come in contact with their propaganda and talking points and want more information. As we understand this sub to have an educational mission and to be a space with the purpose of presenting informative, in-depth, and comprehensive information to people seeking it, we are necessarily dedicated to values such as the pursuit of of historical truth and imparting historical interpretations based on fact and good faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, it felt appropriate to create a post like this where we discuss what Holocaust Denial is, what its methods and background are, what information we have so far comprised on some of its most frequent talking point, and how to combat it further as well as invite our user to share their knowledge and perspective, ask questions, and discuss further. So, without further ado, let&amp;#39;s dive into the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Part 1: Definitions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the Holocaust?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a starting point, it is important to define what is talked about here. Within the relevant scholarly literature and for the purpose of this post, the term Holocaust is defined as the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of approximately six million Jews and up to half a million Roma, Sinti, and other groups persecuted as &amp;quot;gypsies&amp;quot; by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. It took place at the same time as other atrocities and crimes such as the Nazis targeting other groups on grounds of their perceived &amp;quot;inferiority&amp;quot;, like  the disabled and Slavs, and on grounds of their religion, ideology or behavior among them Communists, Socialists, Jehovah&amp;#39;s Witnesses and homosexuals. During their 12-year reign, the conservative estimate of victims of Nazi oppression and murder numbers 11 million people, though newer studies put that number at somewhere between 15 and 20 million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Holocaust Denial?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holocaust Denial is the attempt and effort to negate, distort, and/or minimize and trivialize the established facts about the Nazi genocides against Jews, Roma, and others with the goal to rehabilitate Nazism as an ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the staggering numbers given above, the fact that the Nazi regime applied the tools at the disposal of the modern state to genocidal ends, their sheer brutality, and a variety of other factors, the ideology of Nazism and the broader historical phenomenon of Fascism in which Nazism is often placed, have become – rightfully so – politically tainted. As and ideology that is at its core racist, anti-Semitic, and genocidal, Nazism and Fascism have become politically discredited throughout most of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holocaust Deniers seek to remove this taint from the ideology of Nazism by distorting, ignoring, and misrepresenting historical fact and thereby make Nazism and Fascism socially acceptable again. In other words, Holocaust Denial is a form of political agitation in the service of bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;em&gt;Lying about Hitler&lt;/em&gt; Richard Evans summarizes the following points as the most frequently held beliefs of Holocaust Deniers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) The number of Jews killed by the Nazis was far less than 6 million; it amounted to only a few hundred thousand, and was thus similar to, or less than, the number of German civilians killed in Allied bombing raids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(b) Gas chambers were not used to kill large numbers of Jews at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(c) Neither Hitler nor the Nazi leaderhsip in general had a program of exterminating Europe&amp;#39;s Jews; all they wished to do was to deport them to Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(d) &amp;quot;The Holocaust&amp;quot; was a myth invented by Allied propaganda during the war and sustained since then by Jews who wished to use it for political and financial support for the state of Israel or for themselves. The supposed evidence for the Nazis&amp;#39; wartime mass murder of millions of Jews by gassing and other means was fabricated after the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Richard Evans: &lt;em&gt;Lying about Hitler. History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial&lt;/em&gt;, New York 2001, p. 110]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part 2: What are the methods of Holocaust Denial?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methods of how Holocaust Deniers try to achieve their goal to distort, minimize, or outright deny historical fact vary. One thing though that needs to be stressed from the very start is that Holocaust Deniers are not legitimate historians. Historians engage in interpretation of historical events and phenomena based on the facts found in sources. Holocaust Deniers on the other hand seek to bend, obfuscate, and explain away facts to fight their politically motivated interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

This is not a label they deserve. As Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman point out in their book &lt;em&gt;Denying History&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historians are the ones who should be described as revisionists. To receive a Ph.D. and become a professional historian, one must write an original work with research based on primary documents and new sources, reexamining or reinterpreting some historical event—in other words, revising knowledge about that event only. This is not to say, however, that revision is done for revision’s sake; it is done when new evidence or new interpretations call for a revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historians have revised and continue to revise what we know about the Holocaust. But their revision entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holocaust deniers claim that there is a force field of dogma around the Holocaust—set up and run by the Jews themselves—shielding it from any change. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whether or not the public is aware of the academic debates that take place in any field of study, Holocaust scholars discuss and argue over any number of points as research continues. Deniers do know this.&lt;/p&gt;

They resort to fabricating evidence, the use of pseudo-academic argumentation, cherry-picking of sources, outrageous and not supported interpretation of sources, and emotional claims of far-reaching conspiracy masterminded by Jews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give you an example of how this works that is also used by Evans in &lt;em&gt;Lying about Hitler&lt;/em&gt;, p. 78ff.: David Irving, probably one of the world&amp;#39;s most prominent Holocaust Deniers, has argued for a long time that Hitler was not responsible for the Holocaust, even going so far as to claim that Hitler did not know about Jews being killed. This has been the central argument of his book &lt;em&gt;Hitler&amp;#39;s War&lt;/em&gt; published in 1977 and 1990 (with distinct differences, as in the 1990 edition going even further in its Holocaust Denial). In the 1977 edition on page 332, Irving writes that Himmler&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;was summoned to the Wolf&amp;#39;s Lair for a secret conference with Hitler, at which the fate of Berlin&amp;#39;s Jews was clearly raised. At 1.30 PM Himmler was obliged to telephone from Hitler&amp;#39;s bunker to Heydrich the explicit order that Jews were &lt;em&gt;not to be liquidated&lt;/em&gt; [Italics in the original]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the rest of the book in its 1977 edition and even more so in its 1990s edition, Iriving kept referring to Hitler&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;November 1941 order forbidding the liquidation of Jews&amp;quot; and in his introduction to the book wrote that this was &amp;quot;incontrovertible evidence&amp;quot; that &amp;quot;Hitler ordered on November 30, 1941, that there was to be ‚no liquidation‘ of the Jews.&amp;quot; [&lt;em&gt;Hitler&amp;#39;s War&lt;/em&gt;, 1977, p. xiv].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at what the phone log actually says. Kept in the German Bundesarchiv under the signature NS 19/1438, Telefonnotiz Himmler v. 30.11.1941:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verhaftung Dr. Jekelius (Arrest of Dr. Jekelius)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angebl. Sohn Molotov; (Supposed son of Molotov)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judentransport aus Berlin. (Jew-transport from Berlin.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;keine Liquidierung (no liquidation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Evans remarks about this [p. 79] that it is clear to him as well as any reasonable person reading this document that the order to not liquidate refers to one transport, not – as Irving contends – all Jews.

We know from Himmler&amp;#39;s itinerary that he met Hitler after this phone conversation took place, not before as Irving asserts. Also, if Hitler – as Irving posits – was not aware of the murder of the Jews, how could he order their liquidation to be stopped?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How do we combat Holocaust Denial&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how Holocaust denial is part of a political agenda pandering bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism, combating it needs to take into account this context and any effective fight against Holocaust Denial needs to be a general fight against bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it is important to know that the most effective way of fighting them and their agenda is by engaging their arguments rather than them. This is important because any debate with a Holocaust Denier is a debate not taking place on the same level. As Deborah Lipstadt once wrote: &amp;quot;[T]hey are contemptuous of the very tools that shape any honest debate: truth and reason. Debating them would be like trying to nail a glob of jelly to the wall. (...) We must educate the broader public and academe about this threat and its historical and ideological roots. We must expose these people for what they are.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, someone who for ideological reasons rejects the validity of established facts is someone with whom direct debates will never bear any constructive fruits. Because when you do not even share a premise – that facts are facts – arguing indeed becomes like nailing a pudding to the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what can we do? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educate ourselves, educate others, and expose Holocaust Deniers as the racist, bigots and anti-Semites they are. There is a good reason Nazism is not socially acceptable as an ideology – and there is good reason it should stay that way. Because it is wrong in its very essence. The same way Holocaust Denial is wrong at its very core. Morally as well as simply factually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there are scores of resources out there, where anybody interested is able to educate and inform themselves. The &lt;a href="https://www.ushmm.org/"&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum&lt;/a&gt; has resources as well as a whole encyclopedia dedicated to spread information about the Holocaust. Emory University Digital Resource Center has its &lt;a href="https://www.hdot.org/"&gt;The Holocaust on Trial Website&lt;/a&gt; directly addressing many of the myths and lies spread by Holocaust Deniers and providing a collection of material used in the Irving v. Lipstadt trial. The &lt;a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/denial1.html"&gt;Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/a&gt; as well as the – somewhat 90s in their aesthetics – &lt;a href="http://www.nizkor.org/"&gt;Nizkor Project&lt;/a&gt; also provide easily accessible online resources to inform oneself about claims of Holocaust Deniers. (And there is us too! Doing our best to answer the questions you have!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very important part of fighting Holocaust Denial is to reject the notion that this is a story &amp;quot;that has two sides&amp;quot;. This is often used to give these people a forum or argue that they should be able to somehow present their views to the public. It is imperative to not walk into this fallacious trap. There are no two sides to one story here. There are people engaging in the serious study of history who try to find a variety of perspectives and interpretation based on facts conveyed to us through sources. And then there are Holocaust Deniers who use lies, distortion, and the charge of conspiracy. These are not two sides of a conversation with equal or even slightly skewed legitimacy. This is people engaging in serious conversations and arguments vs. people whose whole argument boils down to &amp;quot;nuh-uh&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s that way because of the Jews&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;lalalala I can&amp;#39;t hear you&amp;quot;. When one &amp;quot;side&amp;quot; rejects facts en gros not because they can disprove them, not because they can argue that they aren&amp;#39;t relevant or valid but rather because they don&amp;#39;t fit their bigoted world-view, they cease to be a legitimate side in a conversation and become the equivalent of a drunk person yelling &amp;quot;No, you!&amp;quot; but in a slightly more sophisticated and much more nefarious way.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;The pikemen were usually bunched at the center of the battle line and operated much like an old Greek phalanx. They would line up 6 deep carrying 15 to 18 foot pikes and march forward until they hit the line of enemy pikemen.

&gt;They were all supposed to be outfitted with a metal breastplate, but they were usually issued only a leathered buff coat, which you would think would make all of this a very messy and very stabby business; but in reality, being run through with a pike was actually a pretty rare thing. The goal was simply to win the contest known as the "push of pike". Which is exactly what it sounds like: you were trying to shove, push and knock off balance the other side until their ranks broke and ran off.

&gt;Sometimes, the "push of pike" was a hell of a contest. But often, one side or the other just wasn\'t that into it, and after a perfunctory showing would break and run. **Then there were my favourite times, when neither side was into it, and they would just kind of stand there and wave their pikes around to make it look like they were fighting, occasionally looking over their shoulders and hoping the generals way in the back were buying it.**

(at the 03:43 mark, for those who prefer listening to it)

Nothing against Mike, I know he surely took this from a solid source. But he doesn\'t quantify the events he\'s talking about, which leaves me highly curious.

So I ask: what is the source for this? If it did happen like he describes, was it a single episode involving a dozen men or a widespread phenomenon throughout the conflict? If so, how did commanders deal with it?

Edit: I should not have referred to the "First English Civil War" in the title, since there is no implication by the podcaster that what I\'m asking about happened in a certain phase of the conflict. Take my question as applying to the entirety of the English Civil Wars.',

About a year and a half ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6790qv/meta_why_do_you_readparticipate_in_askhistorians/) thread asking why you participate in AskHistorians. That thread, follow-up interviews, and a whole lot of lurking became the basis for half my PhD dissertation in which I explored why people participate in online communities. If you want to see the dissertation in all of its 300+ page glory, you can access it [here](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0372890). At long last, I’m sharing some of the results of this work through a series of three posts – this is the first. Since AskHistorians is a place to learn about history, this post discusses what and how we learn through participation, and some of the challenges faced by the sub when it comes to knowledge exchange. The next will discuss AskHistorians’ position on reddit and the last the experiences of the mods. But before I get into the results, I want to provide a bit of background information first.

**Methodology**

The methodology I used to learn about participation in AskHistorians was somewhat ethnographic and results were derived from a variety of sources, such as: 

* **Interviews**: I conducted in-depth interviews with 18 AskHistorians community members as well as exchanged emails and private messages with an additional 4 people. The interviews lasted an average of an hour and thirteen minutes. 9 were with mods (plus 3 former mods), 6 had flair, and 4 were lurkers. 
* **My recruitment post**
* **Observational data**: It was my job for a while to read AskHistorians posts. Not gonna lie– it was pretty awesome! While I read a lot of questions and answers, I mostly read Meta posts, Monday Methods, as well as the round table discussions on AskHistorians’ rules. 
* **A full comment log** of a highly upvoted and controversial post that included removed comments
* **Secondary literature**: I drew from news media, blogs, and peer reviewed literature written about reddit. I also used sources created by AskHistorians\' mods themselves, such as conference presentations and [this podcast](https://askhistorians.libsyn.com/askhistorians-podcast-100-meta-askhistorians-under-the-hood) (which you should totally listen to if you haven\'t yet). 

To analyze the interview data, I used a process known as coding where I read (and reread over and over again) the interviews looking for common themes to describe and explain why my participants were motivated to participate in different ways. If needed I pulled in observational data and secondary literature to supplement and sometimes explain what I had learned through the interviews. For example, if a participant recalled a particular thread, I would read it to understand more about the context of their recollection. 

Coding can be a pretty subjective process, so to help identify and mitigate bias I engaged in a process referred to as reflexivity, in which researchers examine how their beliefs, values, identity, and moral stance affect the work they do. A brief introduction to positionality can be found [here](https://weingartenlrc.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/research-writing-whats-your-positionality/). Since my position relative to the topic I’m discussing is different for each post, I’ve included a section on positionality in each one. Of relevance to this post is my experience as an AskHistorians user. I’ve been a lurker since I discovered the sub in 2012. I have a bachelor’s degree in history, so when I first found AskHistorians, I thought I might be able to provide an answer or two, but quickly realized I had nowhere near the expertise as other community members. Thus, as someone with an interest in history but not the level of knowledge required for answering questions, I found that I shared a lot of the same learning experiences as the other lurkers I interviewed. 

One more quick note before I move onto the results. The quotes I’ve used mostly come from the interviews, but I’ve also included a few public and removed comments. Public comments are linked and attributed to the user who made them. Removed comments are not attributed to anyone and are quoted with all spelling/grammar errors retained. I contacted interview participants whose quotes I’ve included and let them choose how they wanted to be attributed in the posts, e.g., with their first name, username, or pseudonym. If I didn’t hear back I used a pseudonym.  

Now, without further ado, the results! 

**Learning through participation in AskHistorians**

One of the things I love about AskHistorians, and that was reflected in the interviews and meta posts, is that learning through the sub is so often serendipitous. Some variation of: “I didn’t know I had the same question until I heard someone ask it,” was a common refrain. Often this statement was made in reference to learning new topics. The people I interviewed described how they would have never thought to ask about things like the history of strawberry pin cushions, how soldiers treated acne during wartime, or succession in the Mongolian Empire. However, serendipitous learning was also expressed by experts with regards to their own areas of expertise as well. For example, several participants, such as flaired user, u/frogbrooks, described how questions encouraged them to look into their own subject areas from a different angle or take a deep dive into an area they’d previously overlooked:

&gt;A couple of the responses I’ve written have opened doors to new topics that I otherwise wouldn’t have read much about, but ended up being extremely interesting.

Another recurring theme was that AskHistorians made learning about history accessible. Several participants described having an interest in history, but not necessarily the means to get into it in any depth. For example, some didn’t have access to primary or secondary resources, while others described not having the time or energy to try to search through books to find the exact information they wanted. Accessibility was not only important to people who wanted to learn more about history but couldn’t– it was also important to those who thought they hated history based on how it had been taught in school. The interesting questions and engaging writing styles of AskHistorians’ panel of experts helped some of the people I interviewed realize they actually liked history after all, such as lurker, KR: 

&gt;All the history taught in class beyond the ancient Greeks was super duper boring . . . [but] it turns out I actually really love history, and the sub made me see that. 

Not too surprisingly, learning about the past was important to everyone I interviewed; this is, after all, a sub dedicated to discussing history. However, new historical knowledge was not the only thing participants gained. For example, people described learning more about how history is practiced professionally, and the methods historians use. This was expressed not only by total history novices, but also by those who majored in history, such as Jim: 

&gt;I’m learning more from Reddit on historiography than [from] my teachers. 

Jim’s statement also reflects my own experience: as a history major (albeit 15 years ago) I also learned more about historiography and historical methods from AskHistorians than I did during my degree. On the other side of the coin, AskHistorians also provided experts with a way to learn more about how the broader public understands history. For example, u/CommodoreCoCo, a PhD student, said:

&gt;I’ve really learned a lot about how the public perceives history and how, in some ways, it’s been taught to them incorrectly and what misconceptions they have, which is absolutely important if we want to interact with them better and teach them better and train better historians for the future.

In AskHistorians, experts and laypeople come together and meet each other’s needs: laypeople learn things they want to know from experts, which illuminates for experts topic areas that are missing or need to be better addressed.  

While most people described learning new information through participation in AskHistorians, several described learning more about other things, such as negative aspects of human nature. These lessons were not learned after discovering terrible things people did in the past; rather, participants described learning them by seeing the prevalence of racism, sexism, and bigotry on reddit as well as seeing how questions reflect biases, often in an attempt to justify bigotry. Each of the people I spoke to who described learning more about the negative aspects of human nature were mods. For example, when asked what he’d learned, Josh responded: 

&gt;I guess I’d had a rosy-eyed view of humanity and thinking that people are mostly good. And I do think that people are mostly good, but I didn’t think that people could be so malicious. I don’t know if I want to go so far as to say evil, but hurtful to other people and that’s one of the sadder things, but I think it’s one of those things that have made me more mature as a person.

However, non-mods were among those who described learning how to detect bias in question asking, such as Oliver: 

&gt;after a while you get used to the moderators or the person responding saying, ‘you’ve made this assumption here and this is how the question should be stated in my opinion’ and that’s one thing that’s helped me being able to recognize a loaded question, because I find myself often asking, not just in history but in other situations in life . . . [learning to detect bias is] one way that’s helped me in this turbulent time, kind of go, what is this person really saying: is he making underlying assumptions or questions or anything like that? It’s a helpful tool.

**Why learning about history is important to AskHistorians users**

When I asked participants why learning about history was important, a common response was that learning about the past provided a way to better understand the present. Participants described wanting to know why things are the way they are, and then going back and back and back– deep down that rabbit hole I’m sure many of us know all too well. Further, participants, such as Oliver, were also hopeful that learning about the past would help make the present world a better place: 

&gt;I just kind of look around and go man, if everybody just knew the history of this or that, or of this family or the history of their neighbourhood, things would be so much better!

Learning through participation in AskHistorians was described in overwhelmingly positive terms, even when learning more about negative aspects of human nature, which, for example, was often described as contributing to personal growth. 

One last thing I want to highlight before I move on to describing why participants share their expertise is that the learning that happens through participation in AskHistorians is social. We learn not only from what the experts tell us in response to questions, through debate, or in requests for follow up information, but also by watching them in action. Oliver’s quote above showcases how practical, real-life tools, like detecting bias, are learned by watching mods and flairs in action. The “teaching” side isn’t always intentional, overt, nor require subject-specific expertise, and the learning that happens in the sub extends well beyond history. 

**Why participants share their expertise**

Needless to say, while learning through participation on AskHistorians may not always be about history, it is most of the time. Therefore, the sub’s success depends on the contributions of experts. The reasons for sharing expertise were varied, and participants often described several factors that motivated them to share. First, participants described sharing expertise purely because they can, a sentiment known as self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997). For many participants, self-efficacy changed over time. Some described feeling more comfortable answering questions on a wider range of topics as they learned more through school or on their own. Conversely, others described learning more and realizing how much they *didn’t* know, thereby decreasing self-efficacy and their comfort responding to questions. In one case, a participant revoked his topic-specific flair in favour of the more general, “quality contributor flair.” And on the subject of flair, getting it was also important to several participants who saw the merit-based process of earning flair as representative of a history of high-quality contributions. These participants described flair as an important mode of recognition for having knowledge in their subject area and for their contributions to the community. 

Another motivation for contributing expertise was seeing errors that needed to be corrected. Correcting errors was also often the impetus that inspired people to make their first ever comment on AskHistorians. For example, when recounting his first post, former mod u/edXcitizen87539319 alluded to the popular [xkcd comic,](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png) saying, 

&gt;It was a case of ‘somebody’s wrong on the internet’ and I had to correct them. 

Similarly, others were encouraged to participate because they saw that they held expertise in a particular topic area that no one else seemed to have, for example, mod, Anna: 

&gt;I realized there wasn’t anybody out there who was going to answer them but me. So, I basically filled a gap that I had self-identified. 

Most of the time gaps were identified in a given topic area. However, one participant saw how he could fill a gap with particular source material: Oliver, who wasn’t a flaired user or mod, had inherited rare books written about a former president, so when a question came up, he was able to use these books to write a response to a question. His answer got accolades from the OP and was shared on that week’s Sunday Digest. 

Self-efficacy, earning flair, correcting errors, and filling gaps were all important motivations for sharing expertise. However, the next two were the most highly valued: helping and bringing enjoyment to others and promoting historical thinking. When people described sharing their knowledge to make people happy, it was often accompanied not only by a sense of personal happiness but also a sense that some good was being done in the world, as is reflected in this quote from u/TRB1783: 

&gt;If I’ve taught someone today, I’ve done a good thing. You know, something in the real world. Something that matters.

Tied in with the idea that teaching people something new is a worthwhile endeavor is that sharing expertise can be used to promote historical thinking, particularly to an audience that may not have in-depth experience with the humanities and historical methods. AskHistorians was viewed, and valued, as a public history site, which I’ll address in detail in the next post. Before that, however, I’d like to quickly touch on some of the challenges of sharing expertise on reddit. 

**Challenges**

Sharing expertise was described as an overwhelmingly positive experience. However, several participants described challenges as well, mostly in the form of rude or aggressive pushback and abuse. Because such comments are often sent via PM or removed by the mods, much of this pushback is unseen by the vast majority of users. Here’s a slightly redacted example of some of this pushback and abuse that was directed at a user who responded to a question: 

&gt;Christ have you ever thought about changing or removing the stick up your ass? Its sad when someone who claims to be a historian can’t seem to remove his perspective and bias from 60 years later and impose it on a historical context . . . because you are such a prissy uptight know it all you feel compelled to place your tight assed point of view onto it. Grow up Sheldon.

Obviously, the people who make comments such as these are responsible for them. However, there are social, cultural, and technical constructs of reddit that enable them. In my next post, I’ll discuss these factors and how they affect participation on AskHistorians.

&lt;p&gt;When I asked participants why learning about history was important, a common response was that learning about the past provided a way to better understand the present. Participants described wanting to know why things are the way they are, and then going back and back and back– deep down that rabbit hole I’m sure many of us know all too well. Further, participants, such as Oliver, were also hopeful that learning about the past would help make the present world a better place: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just kind of look around and go man, if everybody just knew the history of this or that, or of this family or the history of their neighbourhood, things would be so much better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning through participation in AskHistorians was described in overwhelmingly positive terms, even when learning more about negative aspects of human nature, which, for example, was often described as contributing to personal growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing I want to highlight before I move on to describing why participants share their expertise is that the learning that happens through participation in AskHistorians is social. We learn not only from what the experts tell us in response to questions, through debate, or in requests for follow up information, but also by watching them in action. Oliver’s quote above showcases how practical, real-life tools, like detecting bias, are learned by watching mods and flairs in action. The “teaching” side isn’t always intentional, overt, nor require subject-specific expertise, and the learning that happens in the sub extends well beyond history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why participants share their expertise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, while learning through participation on AskHistorians may not always be about history, it is most of the time. Therefore, the sub’s success depends on the contributions of experts. The reasons for sharing expertise were varied, and participants often described several factors that motivated them to share. First, participants described sharing expertise purely because they can, a sentiment known as self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997). For many participants, self-efficacy changed over time. Some described feeling more comfortable answering questions on a wider range of topics as they learned more through school or on their own. Conversely, others described learning more and realizing how much they &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; know, thereby decreasing self-efficacy and their comfort responding to questions. In one case, a participant revoked his topic-specific flair in favour of the more general, “quality contributor flair.” And on the subject of flair, getting it was also important to several participants who saw the merit-based process of earning flair as representative of a history of high-quality contributions. These participants described flair as an important mode of recognition for having knowledge in their subject area and for their contributions to the community. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another motivation for contributing expertise was seeing errors that needed to be corrected. Correcting errors was also often the impetus that inspired people to make their first ever comment on AskHistorians. For example, when recounting his first post, former mod &lt;a href="/u/edXcitizen87539319"&gt;u/edXcitizen87539319&lt;/a&gt; alluded to the popular &lt;a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png"&gt;xkcd comic,&lt;/a&gt; saying, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a case of ‘somebody’s wrong on the internet’ and I had to correct them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, others were encouraged to participate because they saw that they held expertise in a particular topic area that no one else seemed to have, for example, mod, Anna: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized there wasn’t anybody out there who was going to answer them but me. So, I basically filled a gap that I had self-identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time gaps were identified in a given topic area. However, one participant saw how he could fill a gap with particular source material: Oliver, who wasn’t a flaired user or mod, had inherited rare books written about a former president, so when a question came up, he was able to use these books to write a response to a question. His answer got accolades from the OP and was shared on that week’s Sunday Digest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-efficacy, earning flair, correcting errors, and filling gaps were all important motivations for sharing expertise. However, the next two were the most highly valued: helping and bringing enjoyment to others and promoting historical thinking. When people described sharing their knowledge to make people happy, it was often accompanied not only by a sense of personal happiness but also a sense that some good was being done in the world, as is reflected in this quote from &lt;a href="/u/TRB1783"&gt;u/TRB1783&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’ve taught someone today, I’ve done a good thing. You know, something in the real world. Something that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tied in with the idea that teaching people something new is a worthwhile endeavor is that sharing expertise can be used to promote historical thinking, particularly to an audience that may not have in-depth experience with the humanities and historical methods. AskHistorians was viewed, and valued, as a public history site, which I’ll address in detail in the next post. Before that, however, I’d like to quickly touch on some of the challenges of sharing expertise on reddit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing expertise was described as an overwhelmingly positive experience. However, several participants described challenges as well, mostly in the form of rude or aggressive pushback and abuse. Because such comments are often sent via PM or removed by the mods, much of this pushback is unseen by the vast majority of users. Here’s a slightly redacted example of some of this pushback and abuse that was directed at a user who responded to a question: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ have you ever thought about changing or removing the stick up your ass? Its sad when someone who claims to be a historian can’t seem to remove his perspective and bias from 60 years later and impose it on a historical context . . . because you are such a prissy uptight know it all you feel compelled to place your tight assed point of view onto it. Grow up Sheldon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the people who make comments such as these are responsible for them. However, there are social, cultural, and technical constructs of reddit that enable them. In my next post, I’ll discuss these factors and how they affect participation on AskHistorians. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shout outs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to send a full-on, heart out thanks to everyone in the AH community. Your questions, comments, and even upvotes all helped inform this work. I&amp;#39;m extra thankful to those who took time to respond to my discussion thread and chat with me about their participation, and the mod team for their continued support of my work. I&amp;#39;d like to extend a special shout out to &lt;a href="/u/AnnalsPornographie"&gt;u/AnnalsPornographie&lt;/a&gt; and the mods who read and provided feedback on my posts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least, I&amp;#39;d like to thank my advisors, Drs. Caroline Haythornthwaite and Luanne Freund for all their input into my dissertation work. &lt;/p&gt;

Welcome to the /r/AskHistorians Armistice Day Amateur Ask You Anything.

Today, on Remembrance Day, /r/AskHistorians is opening our doors to new contributors in the broader Reddit community - both to our regular readers who have not felt willing/able to contribute, and to first time readers joining us from /r/Europe and /r/History. Standards for responses in this thread will be relaxed, and we welcome contributors to ask and answer questions even if they don\'t feel that they can meet /r/AskHistorians usual stringent standards. We know that Reddit is full of enthusiastic people with a great deal of knowledge to share, from avid fans of Dan Carlin\'s _Blueprint for Armageddon_ to those who have read and watched books and documentaries, but never quite feel able to contribute in our often-intimidating environment. This space is for you.

We do still ask that you make an effort in answering questions. Don\'t just write a single sentence, but rather try to give a good explanation, and include sources where relevant. 

We also welcome our wonderful WWI panelists, who have kindly volunteered to give up their time to participate in this event. Our panelists will be focused on asking interesting questions and helping provide feedback, support and recommendations for contributors in this thread - please also feel free to ask them for advice.

Joining us today are: 

- /u/Abrytan - Germany 1871-1945
- /u/Bernardito - Moderator | Modern Guerrilla | Counterinsurgency
- /u/CptBuck - Modern Middle East | Islamic Studies
- /u/crossynz - Military Science | Public Perceptions of War
- /u/DBHT14 - 19th-20th Century Naval History
- /u/Klesk_vs_Xaero - Mussolini and Italian Fascism
- /u/k_hopz - Austria-Hungary during the First World War
- /u/NotAWittyFucker - British Regimental System | Australian Army History
- /u/TheAlecDude - WWI
- /u/thefourthmaninaboat - 20th Century Royal Navy
- /u/TheWellSpokenMan - Australia | World War I

Note that flairs and mods may provide feedback on answers, and might provide further context - make sure to read further than the first answer!

Please, feel more than welcome to ask and answer questions in this thread. Our rules regarding civility, jokes, plagiarism, etc, still apply as always - we ask that contributors read the sidebar before participating. We will be relaxing our rules on depth and comprehensiveness - but not accuracy - and have our panel here to provide support and feedback.

Today is a very important day. We ask that you be respectful and remember that WWI was, above all, a human conflict. These are the experiences of real people, with real lives, stories, and families.

If you have any questions, comments or feedback, please respond to the stickied comment at the top of the thread. ',

EDIT: Many thanks for the superb answers from /u/SirGuyGrand, /u/Yorkton, /u/The_Alaskan, /u/24carats, and /u/CopperBrook ! I feel I understand the atmosphere of 1952 much better now.

If I could summarize the points made, it would seem that the British public was already used to the idea that Elizabeth would be Queen, and already admired her. Indeed, her youth may have made her the ideal monarch for the new post-war era. The only concerns in court circles came earlier, when there was a perception that the Earl of Mountbatten and the former Edward VIII were trying to exploit the situation to gain power, but little came of this, in part due to Elizabeth\'s refusal to change the royal family\'s name to Mountbatten. 

I suppose one other point not made below is that the successful reigns of Elizabeth I and Victoria meant that there was already a precedent for young female monarchs becoming popular icons, so that too might have mitigated any sense of unease.

Anyway, thanks again for a very informative discussion!',

                'text' => 'It\'s one of the most commonly asked questions on AskHistorians: did soldiers in the ancient world get PTSD?

It\'s a simple question, one that could potentially have a one word answer (\'yes\' or \'no\'). It\'s one with at least some empathy - we understand that the ancients lived in a harsh, brutal world, and people these days who live through harsh, brutal events often get diagnosed by psychiatrists or psychologists with post-traumatic stress disorder (usually called by the acronym PTSD). It\'s a reasonable question to ask. As would be the far less common question about whether ancient women got PTSD after experiencing the horrors of war that women experience.

It\'s also not a simple question at all, in any way, shape, or form, and clinicians and historians differ fundamentally on how to answer the question. This is because the question can\'t be resolved without first resolving some fairly fundamental questions about human nature, and why we are the way we are, that inevitably end up tipping over into broader philosophical stances.

Put it this way; in 2014, an academic book titled *Combat Trauma And The Ancient Greeks* was edited by Peter Meineck and David Konstan. Lawrence A. Tritle\'s Chapter Four argued that the idea that PTSD is a modern phenomenon, the product of the Vietnam War, is "an assertion preposterous if it was not so tragic." Jason Crowley\'s Chapter Five argues the opposing position: "the soldier [with PTSD] is not, and indeed, can never be, universal."

I am perhaps unusual amongst flairs on /r/AskHistorians in that I teach psychology (and the history thereof) at a tertiary level...and so I have things to say about all of this. There\'s probably going to be more psychology in this post than the usual /r/AskHistorians post; but this is still fundamentally a question about history - the psychology is just setting the scene for how to go about the history.

**So what is PTSD?**

It\'s a psychiatric disorder listed in the American Psychiatric Association\'s Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals since 1980. 

**Okay then, what is a psychiatric disorder?**

In 1980 that the American Psychiatric Association published their third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - the DSM-III - which was the first to include a disorder much like PTSD. The DSM-III was a radical and controversial change, in general, from previous DSMs, and it reflected a movement in psychiatry away from a post-Freudian framework, with its talk of neuroses and conversion disorders, to a more medical framework. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the psychiatric world had been revolutionised by the gradual introduction of a whole suite of psychiatric drugs which seemed to help people with neuroses. The DSM-III reflected psychiatry\'s interest in the medical, and its renewed interest in using medicine (as opposed to talking while on couches) to treat psychiatric disorders. The DSM-III was notably also agnostic towards the causes of psychiatric disorders - it was based on statistical studies which attempted to tease apart clusters of symptoms in order to put different clusters in different boxes.

There are some important ramifications of this. So, with a disease like diabetes, we know the cause(s) of the disease - a chemical in our body called insulin isn\'t doing what it should. As a result of knowing the cause, we also know the treatment: help the body regulate insulin more properly (NB: it may be slightly more complicated than this, but you get the gist). 

However, with a diagnosis like depression (or PTSD), psychiatrists and psychologists *fundamentally do not know what causes it.* Sure, there are news articles every so often identifying such an such a brain chemical as a factor in depression, or such and such a gene as a factor. However, it\'s basically agreed by all sides that while these things may play a role, it\'s a complex stew. When it comes down to it, we\'re not entirely sure why antidepressants work (a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor inhibits the reuptake of a neurochemical called serotonin, and this seems to help depressed people feel a bit better - but it\'s also clear from voluminous neuroscience research that serotonin\'s role in \'not being depressed\' is *way* more complicated than being *the* factor). Some researchers, recently, have argued that depression is in fact several different disorders with a variety of different causes despite basically similar symptoms. PTSD may well be a lot like depression in this sense. It might be that there are several different PTSD-like disorders which all get lumped into PTSD. 

But at a deeper level, the way that psychiatrists put together the DSM-III and its successors lay this out into the open: PTSD, or any other psychiatric disorder in the DSM, is a *construct*. In its original form, it doesn\'t pretend to be anything other than a convenient lumping together of symptoms, *for the specific purpose of a) giving health insurance some kind of basis for believing that the patient has a real disorder; and b) giving the psychiatrist or psychologist some kind of guide as to how to treat the symptoms in the absence of a clear cause (e.g., unlike diabetes)*. 

Additionally, psychologists and psychiatrists typically *don\'t* diagnose PTSD from afar - a psych only really diagnoses someone after talking to them extensively and seeing how their symptoms manifest. Despite the official designations seeming quite clear, too, often psychiatric disorders are difficult to diagnose - there\'s more grey area than you\'d think from the crisp diagnostic criteria in the DSM or the ICD. The most recent version of the DSM, the DSM-5, has begun to move away from pigeonholes and discuss disorders in terms of spectra (e.g., that Asperger\'s disorder is now just part of an autistic spectrum). 

**Okay then, what\'s the current diagnostic criteria for PTSD?**

Well, the full criteria in the DSM-5 are copyrighted, and so I can\'t print them here, but [the VA in the US has a convenient summary which I can copy-paste for your reference](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/ptsd-overview/dsm5_criteria_ptsd.asp):

**Criterion A (one required):** The person was exposed to: death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence, in the following way(s):

*Direct exposure

*Witnessing the trauma

*Learning that a relative or close friend was exposed to a trauma

*Indirect exposure to aversive details of the trauma, usually in the course of professional duties (e.g., first responders, medics)

**Criterion B (one required)**: The traumatic event is persistently re-experienced, in the following way(s):

* Unwanted upsetting memories

* Nightmares

* Flashbacks

* Emotional distress after exposure to traumatic reminders

* Physical reactivity after exposure to traumatic reminders

**Criterion C (one required)**: Avoidance of trauma-related stimuli after the trauma, in the following way(s):

*Trauma-related thoughts or feelings

* Trauma-related reminders

**Criterion D (two required)**: Negative thoughts or feelings that began or worsened after the trauma, in the following way(s):

*Inability to recall key features of the trauma

*Overly negative thoughts and assumptions about oneself or the world

*Exaggerated blame of self or others for causing the trauma

*Negative affect

*Decreased interest in activities

*Feeling isolated

*Difficulty experiencing positive affect

**Criterion E (two required)**: Trauma-related arousal and reactivity that began or worsened after the trauma, in the following way(s):

*Irritability or aggression

*Risky or destructive behavior

*Hypervigilance

*Heightened startle reaction

*Difficulty concentrating

*Difficulty sleeping

**Criterion F (required)**: Symptoms last for more than 1 month.

**Criterion G (required)**: Symptoms create distress or functional impairment (e.g., social, occupational).

**Criterion H (required)**: Symptoms are not due to medication, substance use, or other illness.

**What do psychiatrists and psychologists think cause PTSD?**

With the proviso that the research in this area is very much unfinished, it\'s important to note that **not every modern person who goes to war - or experiences other traumatic events - gets PTSD.** Research does seem to suggest that some people are more prone to developing PTSD than others. There might be some genetic basis to it; after all, in a very real way, PTSD is a disorder which manifests both psychologically and physiologically, and is a disorder which is clearly related to the body\'s infrastructure for dealing with stress (some of which is biochemical).

**So, did ancient soldiers fit these criteria?**

One important problem here is that they\'re no longer around to ask. We almost certainly do not have certain evidence that anyone from antiquity meets all of these criteria. There are certainly some suggestive tales which look familiar to people familiar with PTSD, but Homer and Herodotus and the various other historians simply weren\'t modern psychiatrists. They didn\'t do an interview session with the person in question, asking questions designed to see whether they fit all of these criteria, because, like I said - not modern psychs. It\'s also difficult to know whether symptoms were due to other illness; after all, the ancient Greeks did not have our ability to diagnose other illnesses either.

To reiterate: diagnosis is usually done in privacy, with psychs who know what they\'re looking for asking detailed questions about it. It\'s partially for this reason that psychiatrists and psychologists are reluctant to diagnose people in public (and that there was a big controversy in 2016 about whether psychiatrists and psychologists were allowed to publicly diagnose a certain American political candidate with a certain manifestation of a personality disorder, despite having never met him.) But, well, unless psychs suddenly find a TARDIS, no Ancient Greek soldier has ever been diagnosed with PTSD.

Additionally, it\'s clear from the history of psychiatry that disorders are at the very least culturally situated to some extent. In Freud\'s *Introductory Lectures On Psychoanalysis*, he discusses cases of a psychiatric disorder called hysteria at length, essentially assuming of his readers that they already know what hysteria looks like, in the same way that a psychologist today might start discussing depression without first defining it. Hysteria was *common*, one of the disorders that a general psychiatric theory like Freud\'s would have to cover to be taken seriously. Hysteria is still in the DSM-5, under the name of \'functional neurological symptom disorder\', but was until recently also called \'conversion disorder\'. However, you\'ve probably never had a friend diagnosed with conversion disorder; it\'s not anywhere as common a diagnosis as it used to be a century ago. 

So why did hysteria more or less disappear? Well - hysteria was famously something that, predominantly, women experienced. And there are perhaps obvious reasons why women today might experience less hysteria; we live in a post-feminist world, where women have a great deal more freedom within society to follow their desires (whether they be social, career, emotional, sexual) than they had cooped up in Vienna, where their lives were dominated by the family, and within the family, dominated by a patriarch. But maybe, also, the fact that everybody knew what hysteria was played a role in the way that their symptoms were interpreted, and perhaps even in the symptoms they had, given that we\'re talking about disorders of the mind here, and that the mind with the disorder is the same mind that knows what hysteria is. It might be that hysteria was the socially recognised way of dealing with particular mental and social problems, or that doctors saw hysteria everywhere, even where it wasn\'t actually present. There was certainly a movement in the 1960s - writers like Foucault, Szasz and Laing - who argued that society plays a much bigger role in mental illness than previously appreciated. Some of their arguments, at the philosophical level, are hard to argue against.

PTSD may be similar to hysteria in this way. It might be that there is a feedback loop between knowledge of PTSD and the experience of PTSD, that people who have experienced traumatic events in a society that recognises PTSD can express their minds as such.

**What do psychologists see as the aetiology of PTSD?**

Aetiology is simply the study of causes. Broadly speaking, there is no clear agreed-upon single cause for PTSD, judging by recent research. Sripada, Rauch &amp; Liberzon (2016) argue that four key factors play a role in the occurence and maintenance of PTSD after a traumatic event: a) an avoidance of emotional engagement with the event, b) a failure of fear extinction, meaning that fear responses related to the event are not inhibited as well, c) poorer ability to define the narrower context in which a stress response is justified in civilian life vs a military situation, d) less ability to tolerate the feeling of distress - perhaps something like being a bit less resilient, and e) \'negative posttraumatic cognitions\' - not exactly being sunny in disposition or how you interpret events. Kline et al., (2018) found that with sexual assault survivors, the levels of self-blame immediately after the assault seemed to correlate with the extent to which PTSD was experienced. Zuj et al. (2016) focus on fear extinction as a specific mechanism by which genetic and biochemical factors which correlate with fear extinction might be expressed. There\'s also a body of research suggesting that concussion, and the way that it disorients and causes cognitive deficits, plays a larger role in PTSD than previously suspected.

These factors are likely not to be the be-all and end-all, it should be said - it\'s a complicated issue and research is still in its infancy. But nonetheless, you can see *many* ways in which culture and environment might effect these factors, including the genetic ones. Broadly speaking, some societies are more inclined towards emotional engagement with war events than others - Ancient Greece was heavily militarised in ways that most Anglophone countries in 2018 are not. Some upbringings probably lead to more resilience than others, and depending on the norms of a society, those upbringings might be more concentrated in those societies. The way that people around you interpret your \'negative posttraumatic cognitions\' is going to be different depending on the culture you grow up in. Some societies may be structured in such a way that fear extinction is more likely to occur.

**So in this context, what do Crowley and Tritle actually argue?**

Broadly speaking, what I argued in the last paragraph is the kind of thing that Crowley\'s paper in *Combat Trauma and the Ancient Greeks* argues. There are much more severe injunctions against killing in modern American society than Ancient Greek society, which was not Christian and thus didn\'t have Christianity\'s ideals of the sacredness of life - instead, in many Ancient Greek societies, war was considered something that was fucking glorious, and societies were fundamentally structured around the likelihood of war in ways that modern America very much is not. 

Additionally, in Ancient Greek society, war was a communal effort, done next to people you knew before the war in civilian life and continued to know after the war; in contrast, in modern war situations, where recruits are found within a diverse population of millions, there is a constantly rotating group of people in a combat division who may not have strong ties. Additionally, with the rise of combat that revolves around explosive devices and guns, fighting has changed, and Crowley argued, made people more susceptible to PTSD; these days, if soldiers are in a tense, traumatic situation, it is better for them to be spread out so as to limit the damage when under attack. This, Crowley argues, leads to many more feelings of self-blame and helplessness - the kind of thing that might lead to negative posttraumatic cognitions - because blame for events is not spread out amongst a group in quite the same way.

In contrast, Tritle points to a lot of evidence from ancient sources of people seeming to be traumatised in various ways after battles, ways which do strike veterans with PTSD as being of a piece with their experiences:

&gt;...Young’s claim that there is no such thing as “traumatic memory” might well astound readers of Homer’s Odyssey. On hearing the “Song of Troy” sung by the bard Demodocus at the Phaeacian court, Odysseus dissolves into tears and covers his head so others do not notice (8. 322). 11 Such a response to a memory should seem to qualify as a “traumatic” one, but Young would evidently reject Odysseus’ tears as “traumatic” and other critics are no less coldly analytic.

Tritle - a veteran himself - clearly wishes to see his experiences as being contiguous with those of ancient soldiers. And there is actually something of an industry in putting together reading groups where veterans with PTSD read accounts of warriors from the classics. The books *Achilles In Vietnam* and *Odysseus In America* by the psychiatrist Jonathan Shay explicitly make this link, and it does seem to be useful for many veterans to make this comparison, to view a society where war and warriors are more of a integral part of society than they are in modern America (notwithstanding the fad for saying something about \'respecting your service\'). For Tritle, there\'s something offensive in the way that critics like Crowley dismiss the idea that there was PTSD in Ancient Greece because of their being too \'coldly analytic\'. Tritle also emphasises the physical structure and pathways of the brain: 

&gt; A vast body of ongoing medical and scientific research demonstrates that traumatic stressors —especially the biochemical reactions of adrenaline and other hormones (called catecholamines that include epinephrine, norephinephrine, and dopamine)—hyperstimulate the brain’s hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal lobes and obstruct bodily homeostasis, producing symptoms consistent with combat-stress reactions. In association with these, the glucocorticoids further enhance the impact of adrenaline
and the catecholamines. 

But while I\'m happy as a psychologist for veterans to learn about ancient warriors if evidence suggests that it helps them contextualise their experiences, as a historian I am personally more on Crowley\'s side than Tritle\'s here. The mind is fundamentally an interaction between the brain and the environment around us - we can\'t be conscious without being conscious *of stuff*, and all the chemicals and structures in the brain fundamentally serve that purpose of helping us get around in the environment. And history does tell us that, as much as people are people, the world around us, and the societies we make in that world, can vary very considerably. It may well be that PTSD is to some extent a result of modernity and the way we interact with *modern* environments. This is not to say that people in the past didn\'t have (to use Tritle\'s impressive neurojargon) adrenaline and other hormones that hyperstimulate the brain\'s hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal lobes. Human neuroanatomy and biochemistry doesn\'t change that much, however modern our context. But so many of the things that lead to these brain chemistry changes, that trigger PTSD as an ongoing disorder beyond the heat of battle - or even those which increase the trauma of the heat of battle - seem to be contextual, situational. 

**Edit for a new bit at the end for clarity and conclusiveness**

I am in no way saying that the people with PTSD have something that\'s not really *real*. PTSD as a set of symptoms - whatever its cause, however socially bound it is - causes a whole lot of genuine suffering in people who have already been through a lot. Those people are not faking, or unduly influenced by society. They are simply normal people dealing with a set of circumstances that might not have existed in the same way before the 20th century. I am also not saying that people in the ancient world didn\'t experience psychological trauma of various sorts after traumatic events - clearly they did; I\'m just saying that the specific symptomology of PTSD is enough of a product of its times that we should distinguish between it and the very small amount that we know of the trauma experienced by ancient warriors (or others). And finally, PTSD can be treated successfully by psychologists - if you are suffering from it and you have the means to do so, I do encourage you to make steps in that treatment.

                'html' => '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s one of the most commonly asked questions on AskHistorians: did soldiers in the ancient world get PTSD?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a simple question, one that could potentially have a one word answer (&amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;no&amp;#39;). It&amp;#39;s one with at least some empathy - we understand that the ancients lived in a harsh, brutal world, and people these days who live through harsh, brutal events often get diagnosed by psychiatrists or psychologists with post-traumatic stress disorder (usually called by the acronym PTSD). It&amp;#39;s a reasonable question to ask. As would be the far less common question about whether ancient women got PTSD after experiencing the horrors of war that women experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also not a simple question at all, in any way, shape, or form, and clinicians and historians differ fundamentally on how to answer the question. This is because the question can&amp;#39;t be resolved without first resolving some fairly fundamental questions about human nature, and why we are the way we are, that inevitably end up tipping over into broader philosophical stances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put it this way; in 2014, an academic book titled &lt;em&gt;Combat Trauma And The Ancient Greeks&lt;/em&gt; was edited by Peter Meineck and David Konstan. Lawrence A. Tritle&amp;#39;s Chapter Four argued that the idea that PTSD is a modern phenomenon, the product of the Vietnam War, is &amp;quot;an assertion preposterous if it was not so tragic.&amp;quot; Jason Crowley&amp;#39;s Chapter Five argues the opposing position: &amp;quot;the soldier [with PTSD] is not, and indeed, can never be, universal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am perhaps unusual amongst flairs on &lt;a href="/r/AskHistorians"&gt;/r/AskHistorians&lt;/a&gt; in that I teach psychology (and the history thereof) at a tertiary level...and so I have things to say about all of this. There&amp;#39;s probably going to be more psychology in this post than the usual &lt;a href="/r/AskHistorians"&gt;/r/AskHistorians&lt;/a&gt; post; but this is still fundamentally a question about history - the psychology is just setting the scene for how to go about the history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is PTSD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a psychiatric disorder listed in the American Psychiatric Association&amp;#39;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals since 1980. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay then, what is a psychiatric disorder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1980 that the American Psychiatric Association published their third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - the DSM-III - which was the first to include a disorder much like PTSD. The DSM-III was a radical and controversial change, in general, from previous DSMs, and it reflected a movement in psychiatry away from a post-Freudian framework, with its talk of neuroses and conversion disorders, to a more medical framework. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the psychiatric world had been revolutionised by the gradual introduction of a whole suite of psychiatric drugs which seemed to help people with neuroses. The DSM-III reflected psychiatry&amp;#39;s interest in the medical, and its renewed interest in using medicine (as opposed to talking while on couches) to treat psychiatric disorders. The DSM-III was notably also agnostic towards the causes of psychiatric disorders - it was based on statistical studies which attempted to tease apart clusters of symptoms in order to put different clusters in different boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some important ramifications of this. So, with a disease like diabetes, we know the cause(s) of the disease - a chemical in our body called insulin isn&amp;#39;t doing what it should. As a result of knowing the cause, we also know the treatment: help the body regulate insulin more properly (NB: it may be slightly more complicated than this, but you get the gist). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with a diagnosis like depression (or PTSD), psychiatrists and psychologists &lt;em&gt;fundamentally do not know what causes it.&lt;/em&gt; Sure, there are news articles every so often identifying such an such a brain chemical as a factor in depression, or such and such a gene as a factor. However, it&amp;#39;s basically agreed by all sides that while these things may play a role, it&amp;#39;s a complex stew. When it comes down to it, we&amp;#39;re not entirely sure why antidepressants work (a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor inhibits the reuptake of a neurochemical called serotonin, and this seems to help depressed people feel a bit better - but it&amp;#39;s also clear from voluminous neuroscience research that serotonin&amp;#39;s role in &amp;#39;not being depressed&amp;#39; is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more complicated than being &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; factor). Some researchers, recently, have argued that depression is in fact several different disorders with a variety of different causes despite basically similar symptoms. PTSD may well be a lot like depression in this sense. It might be that there are several different PTSD-like disorders which all get lumped into PTSD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at a deeper level, the way that psychiatrists put together the DSM-III and its successors lay this out into the open: PTSD, or any other psychiatric disorder in the DSM, is a &lt;em&gt;construct&lt;/em&gt;. In its original form, it doesn&amp;#39;t pretend to be anything other than a convenient lumping together of symptoms, &lt;em&gt;for the specific purpose of a) giving health insurance some kind of basis for believing that the patient has a real disorder; and b) giving the psychiatrist or psychologist some kind of guide as to how to treat the symptoms in the absence of a clear cause (e.g., unlike diabetes)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, psychologists and psychiatrists typically &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; diagnose PTSD from afar - a psych only really diagnoses someone after talking to them extensively and seeing how their symptoms manifest. Despite the official designations seeming quite clear, too, often psychiatric disorders are difficult to diagnose - there&amp;#39;s more grey area than you&amp;#39;d think from the crisp diagnostic criteria in the DSM or the ICD. The most recent version of the DSM, the DSM-5, has begun to move away from pigeonholes and discuss disorders in terms of spectra (e.g., that Asperger&amp;#39;s disorder is now just part of an autistic spectrum). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay then, what&amp;#39;s the current diagnostic criteria for PTSD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the full criteria in the DSM-5 are copyrighted, and so I can&amp;#39;t print them here, but &lt;a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/ptsd-overview/dsm5_criteria_ptsd.asp"&gt;the VA in the US has a convenient summary which I can copy-paste for your reference&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Witnessing the trauma&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Learning that a relative or close friend was exposed to a trauma&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criterion C (one required)&lt;/strong&gt;: Avoidance of trauma-related stimuli after the trauma, in the following way(s):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criterion H (required)&lt;/strong&gt;: Symptoms are not due to medication, substance use, or other illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do psychiatrists and psychologists think cause PTSD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the proviso that the research in this area is very much unfinished, it&amp;#39;s important to note that &lt;strong&gt;not every modern person who goes to war - or experiences other traumatic events - gets PTSD.&lt;/strong&gt; Research does seem to suggest that some people are more prone to developing PTSD than others. There might be some genetic basis to it; after all, in a very real way, PTSD is a disorder which manifests both psychologically and physiologically, and is a disorder which is clearly related to the body&amp;#39;s infrastructure for dealing with stress (some of which is biochemical).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, did ancient soldiers fit these criteria?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important problem here is that they&amp;#39;re no longer around to ask. We almost certainly do not have certain evidence that anyone from antiquity meets all of these criteria. There are certainly some suggestive tales which look familiar to people familiar with PTSD, but Homer and Herodotus and the various other historians simply weren&amp;#39;t modern psychiatrists. They didn&amp;#39;t do an interview session with the person in question, asking questions designed to see whether they fit all of these criteria, because, like I said - not modern psychs. It&amp;#39;s also difficult to know whether symptoms were due to other illness; after all, the ancient Greeks did not have our ability to diagnose other illnesses either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reiterate: diagnosis is usually done in privacy, with psychs who know what they&amp;#39;re looking for asking detailed questions about it. It&amp;#39;s partially for this reason that psychiatrists and psychologists are reluctant to diagnose people in public (and that there was a big controversy in 2016 about whether psychiatrists and psychologists were allowed to publicly diagnose a certain American political candidate with a certain manifestation of a personality disorder, despite having never met him.) But, well, unless psychs suddenly find a TARDIS, no Ancient Greek soldier has ever been diagnosed with PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it&amp;#39;s clear from the history of psychiatry that disorders are at the very least culturally situated to some extent. In Freud&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Introductory Lectures On Psychoanalysis&lt;/em&gt;, he discusses cases of a psychiatric disorder called hysteria at length, essentially assuming of his readers that they already know what hysteria looks like, in the same way that a psychologist today might start discussing depression without first defining it. Hysteria was &lt;em&gt;common&lt;/em&gt;, one of the disorders that a general psychiatric theory like Freud&amp;#39;s would have to cover to be taken seriously. Hysteria is still in the DSM-5, under the name of &amp;#39;functional neurological symptom disorder&amp;#39;, but was until recently also called &amp;#39;conversion disorder&amp;#39;. However, you&amp;#39;ve probably never had a friend diagnosed with conversion disorder; it&amp;#39;s not anywhere as common a diagnosis as it used to be a century ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did hysteria more or less disappear? Well - hysteria was famously something that, predominantly, women experienced. And there are perhaps obvious reasons why women today might experience less hysteria; we live in a post-feminist world, where women have a great deal more freedom within society to follow their desires (whether they be social, career, emotional, sexual) than they had cooped up in Vienna, where their lives were dominated by the family, and within the family, dominated by a patriarch. But maybe, also, the fact that everybody knew what hysteria was played a role in the way that their symptoms were interpreted, and perhaps even in the symptoms they had, given that we&amp;#39;re talking about disorders of the mind here, and that the mind with the disorder is the same mind that knows what hysteria is. It might be that hysteria was the socially recognised way of dealing with particular mental and social problems, or that doctors saw hysteria everywhere, even where it wasn&amp;#39;t actually present. There was certainly a movement in the 1960s - writers like Foucault, Szasz and Laing - who argued that society plays a much bigger role in mental illness than previously appreciated. Some of their arguments, at the philosophical level, are hard to argue against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PTSD may be similar to hysteria in this way. It might be that there is a feedback loop between knowledge of PTSD and the experience of PTSD, that people who have experienced traumatic events in a society that recognises PTSD can express their minds as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do psychologists see as the aetiology of PTSD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aetiology is simply the study of causes. Broadly speaking, there is no clear agreed-upon single cause for PTSD, judging by recent research. Sripada, Rauch &amp;amp; Liberzon (2016) argue that four key factors play a role in the occurence and maintenance of PTSD after a traumatic event: a) an avoidance of emotional engagement with the event, b) a failure of fear extinction, meaning that fear responses related to the event are not inhibited as well, c) poorer ability to define the narrower context in which a stress response is justified in civilian life vs a military situation, d) less ability to tolerate the feeling of distress - perhaps something like being a bit less resilient, and e) &amp;#39;negative posttraumatic cognitions&amp;#39; - not exactly being sunny in disposition or how you interpret events. Kline et al., (2018) found that with sexual assault survivors, the levels of self-blame immediately after the assault seemed to correlate with the extent to which PTSD was experienced. Zuj et al. (2016) focus on fear extinction as a specific mechanism by which genetic and biochemical factors which correlate with fear extinction might be expressed. There&amp;#39;s also a body of research suggesting that concussion, and the way that it disorients and causes cognitive deficits, plays a larger role in PTSD than previously suspected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors are likely not to be the be-all and end-all, it should be said - it&amp;#39;s a complicated issue and research is still in its infancy. But nonetheless, you can see &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; ways in which culture and environment might effect these factors, including the genetic ones. Broadly speaking, some societies are more inclined towards emotional engagement with war events than others - Ancient Greece was heavily militarised in ways that most Anglophone countries in 2018 are not. Some upbringings probably lead to more resilience than others, and depending on the norms of a society, those upbringings might be more concentrated in those societies. The way that people around you interpret your &amp;#39;negative posttraumatic cognitions&amp;#39; is going to be different depending on the culture you grow up in. Some societies may be structured in such a way that fear extinction is more likely to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So in this context, what do Crowley and Tritle actually argue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, what I argued in the last paragraph is the kind of thing that Crowley&amp;#39;s paper in &lt;em&gt;Combat Trauma and the Ancient Greeks&lt;/em&gt; argues. There are much more severe injunctions against killing in modern American society than Ancient Greek society, which was not Christian and thus didn&amp;#39;t have Christianity&amp;#39;s ideals of the sacredness of life - instead, in many Ancient Greek societies, war was considered something that was fucking glorious, and societies were fundamentally structured around the likelihood of war in ways that modern America very much is not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in Ancient Greek society, war was a communal effort, done next to people you knew before the war in civilian life and continued to know after the war; in contrast, in modern war situations, where recruits are found within a diverse population of millions, there is a constantly rotating group of people in a combat division who may not have strong ties. Additionally, with the rise of combat that revolves around explosive devices and guns, fighting has changed, and Crowley argued, made people more susceptible to PTSD; these days, if soldiers are in a tense, traumatic situation, it is better for them to be spread out so as to limit the damage when under attack. This, Crowley argues, leads to many more feelings of self-blame and helplessness - the kind of thing that might lead to negative posttraumatic cognitions - because blame for events is not spread out amongst a group in quite the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Tritle points to a lot of evidence from ancient sources of people seeming to be traumatised in various ways after battles, ways which do strike veterans with PTSD as being of a piece with their experiences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...Young’s claim that there is no such thing as “traumatic memory” might well astound readers of Homer’s Odyssey. On hearing the “Song of Troy” sung by the bard Demodocus at the Phaeacian court, Odysseus dissolves into tears and covers his head so others do not notice (8. 322). 11 Such a response to a memory should seem to qualify as a “traumatic” one, but Young would evidently reject Odysseus’ tears as “traumatic” and other critics are no less coldly analytic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tritle - a veteran himself - clearly wishes to see his experiences as being contiguous with those of ancient soldiers. And there is actually something of an industry in putting together reading groups where veterans with PTSD read accounts of warriors from the classics. The books &lt;em&gt;Achilles In Vietnam&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Odysseus In America&lt;/em&gt; by the psychiatrist Jonathan Shay explicitly make this link, and it does seem to be useful for many veterans to make this comparison, to view a society where war and warriors are more of a integral part of society than they are in modern America (notwithstanding the fad for saying something about &amp;#39;respecting your service&amp;#39;). For Tritle, there&amp;#39;s something offensive in the way that critics like Crowley dismiss the idea that there was PTSD in Ancient Greece because of their being too &amp;#39;coldly analytic&amp;#39;. Tritle also emphasises the physical structure and pathways of the brain: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vast body of ongoing medical and scientific research demonstrates that traumatic stressors —especially the biochemical reactions of adrenaline and other hormones (called catecholamines that include epinephrine, norephinephrine, and dopamine)—hyperstimulate the brain’s hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal lobes and obstruct bodily homeostasis, producing symptoms consistent with combat-stress reactions. In association with these, the glucocorticoids further enhance the impact of adrenaline
and the catecholamines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while I&amp;#39;m happy as a psychologist for veterans to learn about ancient warriors if evidence suggests that it helps them contextualise their experiences, as a historian I am personally more on Crowley&amp;#39;s side than Tritle&amp;#39;s here. The mind is fundamentally an interaction between the brain and the environment around us - we can&amp;#39;t be conscious without being conscious &lt;em&gt;of stuff&lt;/em&gt;, and all the chemicals and structures in the brain fundamentally serve that purpose of helping us get around in the environment. And history does tell us that, as much as people are people, the world around us, and the societies we make in that world, can vary very considerably. It may well be that PTSD is to some extent a result of modernity and the way we interact with &lt;em&gt;modern&lt;/em&gt; environments. This is not to say that people in the past didn&amp;#39;t have (to use Tritle&amp;#39;s impressive neurojargon) adrenaline and other hormones that hyperstimulate the brain&amp;#39;s hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal lobes. Human neuroanatomy and biochemistry doesn&amp;#39;t change that much, however modern our context. But so many of the things that lead to these brain chemistry changes, that trigger PTSD as an ongoing disorder beyond the heat of battle - or even those which increase the trauma of the heat of battle - seem to be contextual, situational. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit for a new bit at the end for clarity and conclusiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in no way saying that the people with PTSD have something that&amp;#39;s not really &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;. PTSD as a set of symptoms - whatever its cause, however socially bound it is - causes a whole lot of genuine suffering in people who have already been through a lot. Those people are not faking, or unduly influenced by society. They are simply normal people dealing with a set of circumstances that might not have existed in the same way before the 20th century. I am also not saying that people in the ancient world didn&amp;#39;t experience psychological trauma of various sorts after traumatic events - clearly they did; I&amp;#39;m just saying that the specific symptomology of PTSD is enough of a product of its times that we should distinguish between it and the very small amount that we know of the trauma experienced by ancient warriors (or others). And finally, PTSD can be treated successfully by psychologists - if you are suffering from it and you have the means to do so, I do encourage you to make steps in that treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

In the past this has included virtually everything from Native Americans, Asians, occultism, religion, Napoleon, beards, and masturbation.

This in fact has become so common that in a way has become something of an in-joke with an entire section of our FAQ dedicated to the subject.

I have a couple of thoughts on that subject, not as a mod but as frequent contributor, who has tried to provide good answers to these questions in the past and as a historian who deals with the subject of National Socialism and the Holocaust on a daily basis.

Let me preface with the statement that there is nothing wrong with these questions and I certainly won\'t fault any users asking them for anything. I would merely like to share some thoughts and make some suggestions for any one interested in learning more about Nazism and the Holocaust.

If my experience in researching National Socialism and the Holocaust through literature and primary sources has taught me one thing that I can put in one sentence that is a bit exaggerated in its message:

The person Adolf Hitler is not very interesting.

Let me expand: The private thoughts of Adolf Hitler do not hold the key for understanding Nazism and the Holocaust. Adolf Hitler, like any of us, is in his political convictions, in his role of the "Führer", in his programmatics, and in his success, a creation of his time. He is shaped by the social, political, economic, and discursive factors and forces of his time and any attempt at explaining Nazism, its ideology, its success in inter-war Germany, and its genocide will need to take this account rather than any factors intrinsic to the person of Adolf Hitler. Otherwise we end up with an interpretation along the lines of the great man theory of the 19th century which has been left behind for good reason.

Ian Kershaw in his Hitler biography that has become a standard work for a very good reason, explains this better than I could. On the issue of the question of Hitler\'s personal greatness -- and contained in that the intrinsic qualities of his character -- he writes:

&gt; It is a red-herring: misconstrued, pointless, irrelevant, and potentially apologetic. Misconstrued because, as "great man" theories cannot escape doing, it personalizes the historical process in the extreme fashion. Pointless because the whole notion of historical greatness is in the last resort futile. (...) Irrelevant because, whether we were to answer the question of Hitler\'s alleged greatness in the affirmative or negative, it would in itslef explain nothing whatsoever about the terrible history of the Third Reich. And potentially apologetic because even to pose the question cannot conceal a certain adminration for Hitler, however grudging and whatever his faults

In addressing the challenges of writing a biography of what Kershaw calls an "unperson", i.e. someone who had no private life outside the political, he continues:

&gt; It was not that his private life became part of his public persona. On the contrary: (...) Hitler privatized the public sphere. Private and public merged completely and became insperable. Hiter\'s entire being came to be subsumed within the role he played to perfection: the role of the Führer.
&gt;
&gt; The task of the biographer at this point becomes clearer. It is a task which has to focus not upon the personality of Hitler, but squarely and directly upon the character of his power - the power of the Führer.
&gt;
&gt; That power derived only in part from Hitler himself. In greater measure, it was a social product - a creation of social expectations motivations invested in Hitler by his followers.

The last point is hugely important in that it emphasizes that Nazism is neither a monolithic, homogeneous ideology not is it entirely dependent on Hitler and his personal opinions. The formulation of Nazi policy and ideology exist in a complicated web of political and social frameworks and is not always consistent or entirely dependent on Hitler\'s opinions.

The political system of Nazism must be imagined -- to use the concept pioneered by Franz Neumann in his Behemoth and further expanded upon by Hans Mommsen with concept of cumulative radicalization -- as a system of competing agencies that vie to best capture what they believe to be the essence of Nazism translated into policy with the political figure of the Führer at the center but more as a reference point for what they believe to be the best policy to go with rather than the ultimate decider of policy. This is why Nazism can consist of the Himmler\'s SS with its specific policy, technocrats like Speer, and blood and soil ideologists such as Walther Darre.

And when there is a central decision by Hitler, they are most likely driven by pragmatic political considerations rather than his personal opinions such as with the policy towards the Church or the stop of the T4 killing program.

In short, when trying to understand Nazism and the Holocaust it is necessary to expand beyond the person of Adolf Hitler and start considering what the historical forces and factors were behind the success of Nazism, anti-Semitism in Germany, and the factors leading to "ordinary Germans" becoming participants in mass murder.

This brings me to my last point: When asking a question about National Socialism and the Holocaust (this also applies to other historical subjects too of course), it is worth considering the question "What do I really want to know?" before asking. Is the knowledge if Adolf Hitler masturbated what I want to know? If yes, then don\'t hesitate. If it is really what Freudian psychology of the sexual can tell us about anti-Semitism or Nazism, consider asking that instead.

[This thread about how Hitler got the idea of a Jewish conspiracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4b7lgq/how_did_hitler_get_the_idea_that_there_was_a/) is a good example. Where Hitler personally picked up the idea is historically impossible to say (I discuss the validity of [Mein Kampf as a source for this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4bcxvw/monday_methods_what_does_a_historical_account/d184emm)) but it is possible to discuss the history of the idea beyond the person of Adolf Hitler and the ideological influence it had on the Nazis.

I can only urge this again, consider what exactly you want to know before asking such a question. Is it really the personal opinion of Adolf Hitler or something broader about the Nazis and the Holocaust? Because if you want to know about the latter one, asking the question not related to Hitler will deliver better results and questions that for those of us experienced in the subject easier to answer because they are better historical questions.

Thank you!

&lt;p&gt;Let me preface with the statement that there is nothing wrong with these questions and I certainly won&amp;#39;t fault any users asking them for anything. I would merely like to share some thoughts and make some suggestions for any one interested in learning more about Nazism and the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my experience in researching National Socialism and the Holocaust through literature and primary sources has taught me one thing that I can put in one sentence that is a bit exaggerated in its message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person Adolf Hitler is not very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me expand: The private thoughts of Adolf Hitler do not hold the key for understanding Nazism and the Holocaust. Adolf Hitler, like any of us, is in his political convictions, in his role of the &amp;quot;Führer&amp;quot;, in his programmatics, and in his success, a creation of his time. He is shaped by the social, political, economic, and discursive factors and forces of his time and any attempt at explaining Nazism, its ideology, its success in inter-war Germany, and its genocide will need to take this account rather than any factors intrinsic to the person of Adolf Hitler. Otherwise we end up with an interpretation along the lines of the great man theory of the 19th century which has been left behind for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Kershaw in his Hitler biography that has become a standard work for a very good reason, explains this better than I could. On the issue of the question of Hitler&amp;#39;s personal greatness -- and contained in that the intrinsic qualities of his character -- he writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a red-herring: misconstrued, pointless, irrelevant, and potentially apologetic. Misconstrued because, as &amp;quot;great man&amp;quot; theories cannot escape doing, it personalizes the historical process in the extreme fashion. Pointless because the whole notion of historical greatness is in the last resort futile. (...) Irrelevant because, whether we were to answer the question of Hitler&amp;#39;s alleged greatness in the affirmative or negative, it would in itslef explain nothing whatsoever about the terrible history of the Third Reich. And potentially apologetic because even to pose the question cannot conceal a certain adminration for Hitler, however grudging and whatever his faults&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addressing the challenges of writing a biography of what Kershaw calls an &amp;quot;unperson&amp;quot;, i.e. someone who had no private life outside the political, he continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not that his private life became part of his public persona. On the contrary: (...) Hitler privatized the public sphere. Private and public merged completely and became insperable. Hiter&amp;#39;s entire being came to be subsumed within the role he played to perfection: the role of the Führer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of the biographer at this point becomes clearer. It is a task which has to focus not upon the personality of Hitler, but squarely and directly upon the character of his power - the power of the Führer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That power derived only in part from Hitler himself. In greater measure, it was a social product - a creation of social expectations motivations invested in Hitler by his followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last point is hugely important in that it emphasizes that Nazism is neither a monolithic, homogeneous ideology not is it entirely dependent on Hitler and his personal opinions. The formulation of Nazi policy and ideology exist in a complicated web of political and social frameworks and is not always consistent or entirely dependent on Hitler&amp;#39;s opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political system of Nazism must be imagined -- to use the concept pioneered by Franz Neumann in his Behemoth and further expanded upon by Hans Mommsen with concept of cumulative radicalization -- as a system of competing agencies that vie to best capture what they believe to be the essence of Nazism translated into policy with the political figure of the Führer at the center but more as a reference point for what they believe to be the best policy to go with rather than the ultimate decider of policy. This is why Nazism can consist of the Himmler&amp;#39;s SS with its specific policy, technocrats like Speer, and blood and soil ideologists such as Walther Darre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when there is a central decision by Hitler, they are most likely driven by pragmatic political considerations rather than his personal opinions such as with the policy towards the Church or the stop of the T4 killing program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, when trying to understand Nazism and the Holocaust it is necessary to expand beyond the person of Adolf Hitler and start considering what the historical forces and factors were behind the success of Nazism, anti-Semitism in Germany, and the factors leading to &amp;quot;ordinary Germans&amp;quot; becoming participants in mass murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to my last point: When asking a question about National Socialism and the Holocaust (this also applies to other historical subjects too of course), it is worth considering the question &amp;quot;What do I really want to know?&amp;quot; before asking. Is the knowledge if Adolf Hitler masturbated what I want to know? If yes, then don&amp;#39;t hesitate. If it is really what Freudian psychology of the sexual can tell us about anti-Semitism or Nazism, consider asking that instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4b7lgq/how_did_hitler_get_the_idea_that_there_was_a/"&gt;This thread about how Hitler got the idea of a Jewish conspiracy&lt;/a&gt; is a good example. Where Hitler personally picked up the idea is historically impossible to say (I discuss the validity of &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4bcxvw/monday_methods_what_does_a_historical_account/d184emm"&gt;Mein Kampf as a source for this here&lt;/a&gt;) but it is possible to discuss the history of the idea beyond the person of Adolf Hitler and the ideological influence it had on the Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only urge this again, consider what exactly you want to know before asking such a question. Is it really the personal opinion of Adolf Hitler or something broader about the Nazis and the Holocaust? Because if you want to know about the latter one, asking the question not related to Hitler will deliver better results and questions that for those of us experienced in the subject easier to answer because they are better historical questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

The above is an album, containing a picture of the RAF Radar Squadron stationed at Ballykelly, 1943-45, and all their names. 

Some background: 

My grandfather, Allan Macdonald, is 97 years old. He is in great shape; he drives, he\'s very sharp. For the last 20 odd years he\'s been repairing computers, and donating them to local seniors homes. He drives a few hundred kilometers every week, going out to the flea markets, and driving way outside of our city to his favourite bakery for a loaf of bread and some danishes. 

Every morning he drives over to his local Tim Horton\'s, and they\'ve got an Iced Cappuccino waiting for him. If he ever missed two days in a row, I think they\'d call an ambulance. 

He is a great man, and truly a role model from a greater generation. He\'s unstoppable. In his 70\'s, while he was roofing, he stepped backwards off the roof and wound up nose to nose with my grandmother. He taped up his knee and went back to work. After my grandmother passed, while in his early 90\'s, he built himself a deck, with glass panels around the outside. He\'s an incredible man. 

He leads a very lonely life, his best friend is his cat Elmo, and he often wonders if anybody he knew earlier in life is even still alive. This is something that I greatly want to help with. I would love to be able to fulfill this wish, for such a great and selfless man. 

I would also like to offer him up for an AMA. He\'s lived a pretty incredible life. He\'s done everything from work on Radar during WW2 to solve complex electrical issues on top secret US government projects, to installing untraceable bugs in what I\'ll only say were some pretty effing sensitive locations for the Canadian government.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

Edit: I want to thank you all very much for your kindness and effort. In the next day or two I\'ll be following up on as many of your leads as I can, and replying to everyone individually. I\'m truly grateful for the response I\'ve received. When I show my Grandfather this weekend, I\'m sure he will be equally as enthused. You\'re all great people.  ',

**The humanities PhD is still a vocational degree to prepare students for a career teaching in academia, and there are no jobs. Do not get a PhD in history.**

Look, I get it. Of all the people on AskHistorians, *I get it*. You don\'t "love history;" you love history with everything in your soul and you read history books outside your subfield for fun and you spend 90% of your free time trying to get other people to love history as much as you do, or even a quarter as much, or even just think about it for a few minutes and your day is made. I get it.

You have a professor who\'s told you you\'re perfect to teach college. You have a professor who has assured you you\'re the exception and will succeed. You have a friend who just got their PhD and has a tenure track job at UCLA. You don\'t need an R1 school; you just want to teach so you\'d be fine with a small, 4-year liberal arts college position.

You\'ve spent four or six subsistence-level years sleeping on an air mattress and eating poverty burritos and working three part-time jobs to pay for undergrad. You\'re not worried about more. Heck, a PhD stipend looks like a pay *raise*. Or maybe you have parents or grandparents willing to step in, maybe you have no loans from undergrad to pay back.

It doesn\'t matter. **You are not the exception. Do not get a PhD in history or any of the allied fields.**

**There are no jobs.** The history job market crashed in 2008, recovered a bit in 2011-12...and then disappeared. [Here is the graph from the AHA.](https://www.historians.org/Images/Perspectives/AHA%20Today/2017/11/Advertised-Job-Openings-Compared-to-the-Number-of-New-History-PhDs.jpg) 300 full-time jobs, 1200 new PhDs. Plus all the people from previous years without jobs and with more publications than you. Plus all the current profs in crappy jobs who have more publications, connections, and experience than you. Minus all the jobs not in your field. Minus all the jobs earmarked for senior professors who already have tenure elsewhere. Your obscure subfield will not save you. Museum work is probably more competitive and you will not have the experience or skills. There are no jobs.

**Your job options, as such, are garbage.** Adjunct jobs are unliveable pay, no benefits, renewable but not guaranteed, and *disappearing even though a higher percentage of courses are taught by adjuncts. "Postdocs" have all the responsibilities of a tenure track job for half the pay (if you\'re lucky), possibly no benefits, and oh yeah, you get to look for jobs all over again in 1-3 years. Somewhere in the world. [This is a real job ad.](https://pankisseskafka.com/2017/07/16/rate-my-jil-2018-this-is-what-a-dead-discipline-looks-like/) Your job options are, in fact, garbage.

**It\'s worse for women.** Factors include: students rate male professors more highly on teaching evals. Women are socialized to take on emotional labor and to "notice the tasks that no one else is doing" and do them because they have to be done. Women use maternity leave to be mothers; fathers use paternity leave to do research. Insane rates of sexual harassment, including of grad students, and uni admins that actively protect male professors. The percentage of female faculty drops for each step up the career ladder you go due to all these factors. I am not aware of research for men of color or women of color (or other-gender faculty at all), but I imagine it\'s not a good picture for anyone.

**Jobs are not coming back.**

* History enrollments are crashing because students take their history requirement (if there even still is one) in high school as AP/dual enrollment for the GPA boost, stronger college app, and to free up class options at (U.S.) uni.
* Schools are not replacing retiring faculty. They convert tenure lines to adjunct spots, or more commonly now, just require current faculty to teach more classes.
* Older faculty can\'t afford to retire, or don\'t want to. Tenure protects older faculty from even being asked if they plan to retire, even if they are incapable of teaching classes anymore.

**A history PhD will not make you more attractive for other jobs.** You will have amazing soft skills, but companies want hard ones. More than that, they want direct experience, which you will not have. A PhD might set you back as "overqualified," or automatically disqualified because corporate/school district rules require a higher salary for PhDs.

Other jobs in academia? Do you honestly think that those other 1200 new PhDs won\'t apply for the research librarianship in the middle of the Yukon? Do you really think some of them won\'t have MLIS degrees, and have spent their PhD time getting special collections experience? Do you want to plan your PhD around a job for which there might be one opening per year? Oh! Or you could work in academic administration, and do things like help current grad students make the same mistakes you did. 

**You are not the exception.** 50% of humanities students drop out before getting their PhD. 50% of PhD students admit to struggling with depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues (and 50% of PhD students are lying). People in academia drink more than *skydivers*. Drop out or stay in, you\'ll have spent 1-10 years not building job experience, salary, retirement savings, a permanent residence, a normal schedule, hobbies. Independently wealthy due to parents or spouse? Fabulous; have fun making history the *gentlemen\'s profession* again. 

**Your program is not the exception.** Programs in the U.S. and U.K. are currently reneging on promises of additional funding to students *in progress on their dissertations.* Universities are changing deadlines to push current students out the door without adequate time to do the research they need or acquire the skills they\'d need for any kind of historical profession job or even if they want a different job, the side experience for that job. 

I called the rough draft of this essay "A history PhD will destroy your future and eat your children." No. This is not something to be flip about. **Do not get a PhD in history.**

...But I also *get it*, and I know that for some of you, there is absolutely nothing I or anyone else can say to stop you from making a colossally bad decision. And I know that some of you in that group are coming from undergrad schools that maybe don\'t have the prestige of others, or professors who understand what it takes to apply to grad school and get it. So in comments, I\'m giving advice that I hope with everything I am you will not use.

This is killing me to write. I love history. I spend my free time *talking about history on reddit.* You can find plenty of older posts by me saying all the reasons a history PhD is fine. No. It\'s not. **You are not the exception. Your program is not the exception. Do not get a PhD in the humanities.**',

Somewhere in the world. &lt;a href="https://pankisseskafka.com/2017/07/16/rate-my-jil-2018-this-is-what-a-dead-discipline-looks-like/"&gt;This is a real job ad.&lt;/a&gt; Your job options are, in fact, garbage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s worse for women.&lt;/strong&gt; Factors include: students rate male professors more highly on teaching evals. Women are socialized to take on emotional labor and to &amp;quot;notice the tasks that no one else is doing&amp;quot; and do them because they have to be done. Women use maternity leave to be mothers; fathers use paternity leave to do research. Insane rates of sexual harassment, including of grad students, and uni admins that actively protect male professors. The percentage of female faculty drops for each step up the career ladder you go due to all these factors. I am not aware of research for men of color or women of color (or other-gender faculty at all), but I imagine it&amp;#39;s not a good picture for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jobs are not coming back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History enrollments are crashing because students take their history requirement (if there even still is one) in high school as AP/dual enrollment for the GPA boost, stronger college app, and to free up class options at (U.S.) uni.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schools are not replacing retiring faculty. They convert tenure lines to adjunct spots, or more commonly now, just require current faculty to teach more classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Older faculty can&amp;#39;t afford to retire, or don&amp;#39;t want to. Tenure protects older faculty from even being asked if they plan to retire, even if they are incapable of teaching classes anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A history PhD will not make you more attractive for other jobs.&lt;/strong&gt; You will have amazing soft skills, but companies want hard ones. More than that, they want direct experience, which you will not have. A PhD might set you back as &amp;quot;overqualified,&amp;quot; or automatically disqualified because corporate/school district rules require a higher salary for PhDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other jobs in academia? Do you honestly think that those other 1200 new PhDs won&amp;#39;t apply for the research librarianship in the middle of the Yukon? Do you really think some of them won&amp;#39;t have MLIS degrees, and have spent their PhD time getting special collections experience? Do you want to plan your PhD around a job for which there might be one opening per year? Oh! Or you could work in academic administration, and do things like help current grad students make the same mistakes you did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are not the exception.&lt;/strong&gt; 50% of humanities students drop out before getting their PhD. 50% of PhD students admit to struggling with depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues (and 50% of PhD students are lying). People in academia drink more than &lt;em&gt;skydivers&lt;/em&gt;. Drop out or stay in, you&amp;#39;ll have spent 1-10 years not building job experience, salary, retirement savings, a permanent residence, a normal schedule, hobbies. Independently wealthy due to parents or spouse? Fabulous; have fun making history the &lt;em&gt;gentlemen&amp;#39;s profession&lt;/em&gt; again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your program is not the exception.&lt;/strong&gt; Programs in the U.S. and U.K. are currently reneging on promises of additional funding to students &lt;em&gt;in progress on their dissertations.&lt;/em&gt; Universities are changing deadlines to push current students out the door without adequate time to do the research they need or acquire the skills they&amp;#39;d need for any kind of historical profession job or even if they want a different job, the side experience for that job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called the rough draft of this essay &amp;quot;A history PhD will destroy your future and eat your children.&amp;quot; No. This is not something to be flip about. &lt;strong&gt;Do not get a PhD in history.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...But I also &lt;em&gt;get it&lt;/em&gt;, and I know that for some of you, there is absolutely nothing I or anyone else can say to stop you from making a colossally bad decision. And I know that some of you in that group are coming from undergrad schools that maybe don&amp;#39;t have the prestige of others, or professors who understand what it takes to apply to grad school and get it. So in comments, I&amp;#39;m giving advice that I hope with everything I am you will not use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is killing me to write. I love history. I spend my free time &lt;em&gt;talking about history on reddit.&lt;/em&gt; You can find plenty of older posts by me saying all the reasons a history PhD is fine. No. It&amp;#39;s not. &lt;strong&gt;You are not the exception. Your program is not the exception. Do not get a PhD in the humanities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                'text' => 'For those not familiar with *Frontier* it is a six episode series on Netflix that shows fur traders in the 18th century, focusing on the Hudson Bay area.  The show follows several factions, including Scots, Native Aboriginals, the Hudson Bay Company, the French, and "Americans".  The characters seem to have no qualms about killing one another over trading rights and land.  some examples from the show include kidnapping a native chief\'s grandson to use as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations and killing English soldiers in order to steal their supplies.

My overall question is this:  How violent was the fur trade in the 18th century?  Did competitors resort really resort to violence and killing?  If so, did colonial or European governments try to intervene?  What about the natives?

A couple other questions:

* Did the Hudson Bay Company (or other large companies) really employ private military forces?  Or would the English armed forces come to their assistance?
* Would people in what is now Canada in the early to mid 18th century even have a sense of who an "American" was prior to the Revolutionary War?',

Couldn\'t someone set up shop anywhere on the coast and boil water to obtain all the salt they want and sell it for a great profit?

Did people do this and I have not heard about it? Or was it not possible for some reason?

What was the main way that people obtained salt in the past?

Sunday stems from the Latin, "dies solis."

Monday stems from the Anglo-Saxon, "monandaeg"

Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are named after the Norse gods Tyr, Odin, Thor and Frigg respectively. 

Saturday is named after the Roman god Saturn.

I guess what I\'m confused about is why are these various pagan religions all smashed together in our days of the week? The Romance languages seem to all utilize only the Roman gods in their names for the days of the week, but even they still named Sunday and Monday after the sun and moon (eg: *Domingo* and *Lunes* in Spanish)

Why didn\'t the Germanic languages only utilize their local Gods? Why the blending of various deities?

**EDIT**: /u/reinhold23 privately pointed me towards the work of Rudolf Simek, namely his work on Interpretatio Germanica, which was very helpful as well, just for all who are curious about the specific adaptation of German gods to the seven day work week.',

As we have done a few times in the past for topics that have arrived suddenly, and caused a high number of questions, we decided that creating a Megathread to "corral" them all into one place would be useful to allow people interested in the topic a one-stop thread for it.

As with previous Megathreads, keep in mind that like an AMA, top level posts should be questions in their own right. However, while we do have flairs with specialities related to this topic, we do not have a dedicated panel on this topic, so anyone can answer the questions, as long as that answer meets our standards of course ([see here for an explanation of our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules))!

**We\'re closing in on solving this. I\'ll keep you guys posted!**

**Update**: on the site of the [Flemish](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/03/23/wie-kent-dit-mysterieuze-doosje-uit-1918--/) and [Walloon](https://www.rtbf.be/culture/arts/detail_le-musee-art-histoire-de-bruxelles-fait-appel-au-public-pour-elucider-un-mystere?id=9872751) public broadcasters. And again, you saw it first on Reddit :)

We (the [Art &amp; History Museum](http://www.kmkg-mrah.be/cinquantenaire-museum) in Brussels, Belgium) currently have a temporary [exhibition](http://www.kmkg-mrah.be/expositions/horta-wolfers) about the Wolfers family (famous jewlers from Brussels) and Victor Horta (famous art nouveau architect).

During this exhibition the curator received this [silver box](https://imgur.com/a/9kkpl). We know some things about it, but there is also alot we don\'t know. **That\'s why we need your help (updates below!)**

Here is what we know (see [album](https://imgur.com/a/9kkpl)):

- It\'s a silver cigar box, made by Wolfers (there is a quality mark on the back: triangle with three stars, 800 and Wolfres freres). The 800 is a gradation of the quality of the silver.
- On the front is says *Zur Erinnerung an Gemeinsame Arbeit in Belgien. Brüssel, den 1. november 1918*. This translates to \'In memory of the joint work in Belgium. Brussels, the first of november, 1918\'
- The box traveled from Belgium (where it was commissioned/made and bought) to Germany and back to Belgium 

Here is what we presume:

- The names on the box are officials (not military personnel: it would be very likely to have a military grade engraved together with the names)
- The box is a souvenir for people who worked together in occupied Belgium. With this in mind, it\'s not unlikely there were more of the same boxes made and handed out (there are 16 autographs on the box, perhaps 16 of these boxes were made)
- The box was made/commissioned as a souvenir as soon as this group of people realised the war was over (the date is prior to the armistice: 1 november 1918 vs 11 november 1918).
- There are 14 autographs on top of the box, 2 on the front. Perhaps the two on the front are from the officials in charge
- There is one autograph (on the front) that is perfectly readable: Brinckman(n). All the others are open to discussion.

**We would like your help with the following:**

- Best case: you have seen this (kind of) box with someone you know (a neighbour, relative,...) and know more about it. 
- The signatures are not at all clear: we would like to know the names of everyone that signed (this might help in locating those persons or finding out more about them)
- We would like to know more about the context: who were these people? What was their job in occupied Belgium?

**update**: This was already posted in lots of other subreddits, and we might have some leads: \'Brinckmann\' might be [this guy](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Erich_Brinckmann). \'Zöbisch\' might be Septa Zöbisch, an opera singer, who knew Brinckmann. Brinckmann was involved in the German \'Flamenpolitik\', a way to win the hearts and minds of the Flemish (article about that [here](http://www.cegesoma.be/docs/media/chtp_beg/chtp_11/chtp11_002_Dossier_Tiedau.pdf) in Dutch) through promoting culture. Nothings sure, but as said this might be a valuable lead.

Thanks in advance to help us solve this mystery!',

Sejanus\' daughter
"His children also were put to death by decree, the girl (whom he had betrothed to the son of Claudius) having been first outraged by the public executioner on the principle that it was unlawful for a virgin to be put to death in the prison. His wife Apicata was not condemned, to be sure, but on learning that her children were dead, and after seeing their bodies on the Stairway..." Cassius Dio, Roman History, LVIII.11.5-6.

"It was next decided to punish the remaining children of Sejanus, though the fury of the populace was subsiding, and people generally had been appeased by the previous executions. Accordingly they were carried off to prison, the boy, aware of his impending doom, and the little girl, who was so unconscious that she continually asked what was her offence, and whither she was being dragged, saying that she would do so no more, and a childish chastisement was enough for her correction. Historians of the time tell us that, as there was no precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin, she was violated by the executioner, with the rope on her neck. Then they were strangled and their bodies, mere children as they were, were flung down the Gemoniae." Tacitus, Annals, V.9.

Caligula\'s daughter
"...and his daughter had her brains knocked out against a wall." Suetonius, Caligula, 59.

EDIT: changed Cassius Dio reference from the incorrect Cassius Dio, LVIII.5-6. (typo) to Cassius Dio, Roman History, LVIII.11.5-6. Also NSFW tag was added (presumably by a mod as I don\'t know how to add them, so a sincere thanks to whoever marked the post as NSFW).',

&lt;p&gt;Caligula&amp;#39;s daughter
&amp;quot;...and his daughter had her brains knocked out against a wall.&amp;quot; Suetonius, Caligula, 59.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: changed Cassius Dio reference from the incorrect Cassius Dio, LVIII.5-6. (typo) to Cassius Dio, Roman History, LVIII.11.5-6. Also NSFW tag was added (presumably by a mod as I don&amp;#39;t know how to add them, so a sincere thanks to whoever marked the post as NSFW).&lt;/p&gt;

She\'s made the claim that academia is covering up goddess worship, by shelving and downplaying evidence such as venus figurines, and by "writing them off" as porn/depictions of individuals/fertility idols. This is a red flag to me, because it reminds me of a lot of conspriacy theories, where it monopolizes interpretation of evidence by calling other theories cover-ups. What is the consensus among historians about this subject?

She\'s also made the claim that pre-patriarchal societies were led by priestesses, which were/are written off as temple prostitutes because (according to her) they still practiced free sex, when the new, patriarchal society of mesopotamia was monogamous.

            'html' => '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I try to keep an open mind, but a lot of what she said seemed to be speculation, so I want to get multiple opinions on this. Wikipedia seems to say that it&amp;#39;s a lot less clear than she&amp;#39;s led the class to believe, and she&amp;#39;s raised some red flags that make me suspect that she&amp;#39;s biased towards the Goddess movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s made the claim that academia is covering up goddess worship, by shelving and downplaying evidence such as venus figurines, and by &amp;quot;writing them off&amp;quot; as porn/depictions of individuals/fertility idols. This is a red flag to me, because it reminds me of a lot of conspriacy theories, where it monopolizes interpretation of evidence by calling other theories cover-ups. What is the consensus among historians about this subject?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s also made the claim that pre-patriarchal societies were led by priestesses, which were/are written off as temple prostitutes because (according to her) they still practiced free sex, when the new, patriarchal society of mesopotamia was monogamous. This seems pretty believable compared to her other claims of cover-ups, but I&amp;#39;d still like to see a historian&amp;#39;s opinion on this.&lt;/p&gt;

Quoting from wikipedia:

&gt;Between 1925 and 1927, Mussolini progressively dismantled virtually all constitutional and conventional restraints on his power, thereby building a police state. A law passed on Christmas Eve 1925 changed Mussolini\'s formal title from "president of the Council of Ministers" to "head of the government" (though he was still called "Prime Minister" by most non-Italian outlets). He was no longer responsible to Parliament and could only be removed by the king. While the Italian constitution stated that ministers were only responsible to the sovereign, in practice it had become all but impossible to govern against the express will of Parliament. The Christmas Eve law ended this practice, and also made Mussolini the only person competent to determine the body\'s agenda. This law transformed Mussolini\'s government into a de facto legal dictatorship. Local autonomy was abolished, and podestàs appointed by the Italian Senate replaced elected mayors and councils.

Both threads have been nuked from orbit.

1. Unless the jokes are relevant, they will be removed....and even that is getting pushed to the breaking point.  Meta threads are really the only place where we are looser with the rules on this.

1. Stay on topic or relevant.  Your trip to the gas station today or the pizza you ate today had better be relevant, or it goes.

1. Keep it in /r/politics.  No seriously, I\'m not kidding.  Any discussion of modern politics after the early 90\'s will be nuked.  It has to be VERY RELEVANT to be allowed after that.

1. Posts had better start being backed up, no more idle speculation.  There are far to many posts that are just random wild guesses, half-informed, or are based on what is honestly a grade-school level of understanding of the material.  

This sub has grown massively based on it\'s reputation, and we are going to maintain it.  You, the user base has to help maintain that reputation, downvote posts that are not fitting of this subs standards, report spam and garbage posts, and hold each other to a higher standard.  

The moderation team does not want to have to turn this completely into /r/askscience in it\'s strict posting standards, but if we cannot trust the user base to police itself, we will have to continue to enact tougher and tougher standards until this sub becomes what is honestly an overly dry and boring place.

I accepted that NINA was a myth and moved on. This past week I was reading Tom Nichol\'s *The Death of Expertise* which included [this story](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/01/the-teen-who-exposed-a-professor-s-myth.html) about a 14 year old girl who basically did a cursory google search and overturned what had been looking like something of a consensus, or at least an assertion that went unchallenged and found loads of examples of NINA signs that fundamentally question Jensen\'s conclusion, so much so that Nichols uses it as a rare example of expert failure and amateur success that gets lots of press but is really unusual.

I have a few questions on this:

1. Was this a research failure, and if so how large? 

Jensen\'s 2002 article said that: "An electronic search of all the text of the several hundred thousand pages of magazines and books online at Library of Congress, Cornell University Library and the University of Michigan Library, and complete runs of The New York Times and The Nation, turned up about a dozen uses of NINA. 17 The complete text of New York Times is searchable from 1851 through 1923. Although the optical character recognition is not perfect (some microfilmed pages are blurry), it captures most of the text. A search of seventy years of the daily paper revealed only two classified ads with NINA"

Was that wrong? Was he looking in the wrong places? Or did the databases just not exist/weren\'t good enough for these purposes to be making the conclusions that he did?

In other words, what exactly happened here? Because it looks like something went very wrong.

2 . Did Rebecca Fried\'s article actually debunk this theory? Or is that overstated?

3 . What\'s the state of play on the history of NINA in America?',

All of the age-appropriate material is extremely deferential to George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson etc and treats American Independence as an unquestionably noble cause. This concerns me, because I\'ve done a bit of research into the era, and much of the country\'s founding myths are just that, myths. A good example is the idea that British administration in America was uniquely tyrannical, when in fact American colonists had more representation and outlets for popular sovereignty than people in the UK proper did. Another is the so called "Intolerable Acts" which weren\'t particularly intolerable by any sort of standard, they were taxes levied on the colonies to cover the cost of their defense, and the granting of autonomy to the newly conquered Québec which allowed them to remain Francophone, use French civil law and practice their Catholic faith openly under the Protestant British administration. Finally, there\'s the reality that for all the rhetoric about liberty, the United States was intended to be an aristocratic slaver republic, Congress in it\'s original form and franchise was less representative than parliament and it was only due to the British Empire\'s embargo on the slave trade in the early 19th century that the slave economy of America began to whither, which made abolitionism a viable popular movement.

&gt;Pepys’s philandering also took place much closer to home. He had an eye for several of the young maids that worked in his household and engaged in a short, but intense, sexual relationship with his wife’s companion Deborah or ‘Deb’ Willet, which began around 1668. On 25 October of that year Pepys’s adultery was spectacularly uncovered when Elizabeth Pepys caught them ‘together’: ‘my wife, coming up suddenly, did find me imbracing the girl … and endeed, I was with my main in her cunny’. Elizabeth was angry and distraught, Deb was dismissed shortly afterwards and Pepys apparently ended the affair. 

&gt;Although Pepys’s libido seems to have been insatiable, it was not always welcome. His opportunistic and predatory groping of women when the situation arose was resisted, fought-off and spurned by some. On 18 August 1667 Pepys wrote: 

&gt;‘into St. Dunstan’s Church, where I … stood by a pretty, modest maid, whom I did labour to take by the hand and the body; but she would not, but got further and further from me, and at last I could perceive her to take pins out of her pocket to prick me if I should touch her again’. 

&gt;Pepys sometimes showed remorse for his behaviour: ‘I went to her and played and talked with her and, God forgive me, did feel her; which I am much ashamed of’, yet he still recorded these intimate sexual experiences in his diary, concealing them with a comical combination of English, Spanish, French and Latin as if embarrassed to commit them to the page: ‘there did what je voudrais avec her, both devante and backward, which is also muy bon plazer’ (3 Jun 1666). Writing them down undoubtedly gave him pleasure and acted as absolution. 

I\'ve read a fair amount of the diary, and I\'ve lost count of the number of times he engages in behaviour towards women that would be considered abusive today.

I am interested if this was normal for the age; and if it wasn\'t, if it had something to do with his position of power or just with his personal lack of self-control.

Would he be seen as a "pervert" in his lifetime, or was abuse *that* normalized that all this wouldn\'t be considered out of the ordinary?

Edit: I feel that I need to clarify what prompted my question. It is not the fact that abuse was prevalent during that age; it still is today, and I wouldn\'t expect 17th century England to be better in comparison.

**What surprises me in Pepys isn\'t that he engages in abuse, it\'s the *extreme* frequency of it.** One can almost say that there isn\'t an occasion where he can abuse a woman or girl that he does not do so. Sharing a carriage with a woman, sitting next to a woman in church, going to a store and being attended by a woman, being in a room alone with the maid, etc. are all occasions that often end up with him trying to grope them (or worse), even if they resist (which doesn\'t stop him from trying as much as he is able). It seems like he completely lacks self-control when it comes to this, and I can\'t figure out if this is explained by the fact that it was *that* normal, or if he was an exceptionally terrible example (since I\'ve seen his impulsiveness being noted as unusual in articles about him).',

He did not believe that anything that could kill a horse so beautiful.

That being said, I can\'t find any uses of Cataphracts being used in the Byzantine empire, or in any other context past around 1100. Did the Nisean horse lose its exclusivity and value with the advent of the selectively bred western heavy cavalry? From the limited reading I\'ve done, early knights of Feudal Europe also used selectively bred horses in combat that were stockier, slightly slower but far hardier than the average horse - these characteristics are akin to the Nisean. Would the Nisean still maintain its superiority in, say, 1200? 

Or does its legendary status only hold due to the fact that hellenic and eastern horses were traditionally smaller and slighter, so the Nisean stood out completely? Would it still be a behemoth in comparison to the Western European warhorses of the 13th century?',

She claims that as a child the airforce bombed the swamp next to her house, which is now the Red Lake Peatland Scientific and Natural Area. She claims that after a few years of bombing they dropped between one and three nuclear bombs in one bombing. For the longest time I didn\'t believe her but then I found this article published by the Minnesota Department of Resources magazine http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/mcvmagazine/issues/2016/jan-feb/big-bog-SRA.html.

My questions are:


1. How reliable is this magazine and where can I find corroborating primary sources. I don\'t have JSTOR, archival, and research librarian access any more which is where I would have started.


2. The magazine seems to suggest that more than one bomb was dropped but that they didn\'t have their nuclear cores. The magazine states that the detonation was visible from International Falls which I confirmed with another octogenarian from the Falls. It also states that the detention created a sizable, "lake." My suspicion is that in order to be visible from 70mi away that the bombs would have had to have their cores. Is this true and where can I find more precise specifications on the bombs.


1. The bombs were dropped on lands abutting the Red Lake Indian Reservation. How common was it to test nuclear devices near tribal land?


1. What is the risk to lake and the people who lived in that area? Is there a national registry of cancer rates or something like that?

&lt;p&gt;Also, I understand Queen Victoria felt strongly that women should not be in a position of power. How did she reconcile that with her own position as Queen? I believe I read once that she said she didn&amp;#39;t consider herself really a woman, but was somehow blessed with the brain of a man. Towards the end of her reign, did she ever soften her stance towards feminism or concede that other women might have the same abilities that she had?&lt;/p&gt;

The comment makes some pretty bold claims, and I was wondering how well some of them are supported by historical evidence.

Particularly:

1) Did the cultural revolution really "erase" Chinese culture in a fundamental and lasting way, particularly for citizens outside the cultural elite?

2) To what extent can the effects of the cultural revolution be perceived in contomporary Chinese behaviour and attitudes.

1) what would you have to do to move back then? Could a free peasant just move into a city, find some work there and stay? Could a skilled craftsmen , without any invitation, move from e.g. Genoa to Lisbon, and start working there?

Still, though, the coconut palm is obviously crucial to their existence, so I was wondering if any real Polynesian culture utilized it to such a great extent.

&lt;p&gt;Now, my title might not be 100% fair to the film, as we are clearly shown workers digging gardens of some kind (probably, given what I know of Polynesia, for sweet potatoes) and even in the song that says &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;We use each part of the coconut / That&amp;#39;s all we need&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; they refer (as I showed above) to cooking meat, probably pork (given what I know about Polynesia - and also the surprisingly dark running gags about eating poor Pua).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, though, the coconut palm is obviously crucial to their existence, so I was wondering if any real Polynesian culture utilized it to such a great extent. It should be noted that Moana&amp;#39;s intention to accurately depict ancient Polynesia is about as strong as Tolkien&amp;#39;s was to depict medieval England, so creative liberties are expected, but still.&lt;/p&gt;

I was in /r/HistoryPorn and saw this picture: http://i.imgur.com/X5W63uV.png

What surprised me is that she indeed has her breast bare and I was wondering why this would be.

From what I can see in the picture, they could make clothes (although it does seem quite restrictive just above the breasts) so that can\'t be the reason.

It\'s stated that she just had  a son, could it be to facilitate feeding the young one? If that\'s so, wouldn\'t there be easier ways?

Anyways, anyone know anything about this type of dress? Was it common in Korea at that time? Any explanation as to why she would run with her breasts bare?

Many thanks ;)',

When you ask an extremely specific question someone may have knowledge of the answer but it\'s just a minor part of their area of expertise and you don\'t elicit their passion for history; their answer will be short, bland, to the point, and often unsourced.

When more open ended questions were allowed, historians could apply the situation/question to their field/interest and you would get these amazing detailed long posts, sometimes spanning multiple comments, heavily sourced that were just a treat to read, and which had more scholaristic integrity. As the frequency of these high level comments went down, what we as a sub have let slide has gotten worse and worse, as an almost desperation for content has allowed lackluster comments to survive mod purging. These comments are generally factually accurate, but not as long as we would like, and often not actually sourced (sources are nice, i miss them)


I think this sub would be improved if the quality requirement of comments was ramped back up, while the standard for what is an acceptable question was reduced. 

Questioners are not necessarily historians, and even a really poor, vague, uninformed question can lead to an excellent commenter dispelling misconceptions or enlightening us on a period of history.

I really feel like that rule hurt the quality of askhistorians, both in terms of enjoyability of reading, and in terms of quality/quantity, and I\'d love a discussion with the subreddit, or for some mods to consider such a shift.

Thanks for reading.


Edit: To be clear I am in no way advocating a reduction in rules regarding commenting. Nor am I against strict moderation of comments.


Edit: I\'m also for more comment removal, I think that quantity will lead to quality as long as you remove the bad quality comments, like how a larger country will do better in the olympics.',

We [strongly encourage](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_sources) people to include sources in their answers that back up their claims and provide further reading. Although it\'s always been optional to cite your sources up front (and will remain so for the foreseeable future), it\'s great to see that the trend in the subreddit has been towards favouring well sourced answers.

However, I\'d like to point out that in this subreddit when we say "source" we\'re using it in the academic sense of a text or other published material that supports what you\'re saying. If you\'re unclear on what that means, our resident librarian-mod /u/caffarelli has posted an short and sweet [introduction to sources in history and academia](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1jsabs/what_it_means_to_post_a_good_answer_in/cbhsgqx).

We do **not** mean the reddit meme of providing a snippet of biographical information which (supposedly) establishes your authority to speak on the subject, e.g.:

&gt; Source: I\'m a historian of Greek warfare.

or

&gt; Source: I\'ve excavated at Thermopylae.

You may very well be a historian of Greek warfare who\'s excavated at Thermopylae, and that\'s a splendid reason to decide to answer a question about how many people fought there. By all means say so. But the purpose of citing a source is to provide a *verifiable* reason for us to believe that your answer is authoritative. Your credentials and experience aren\'t a source, and they don\'t achieve that, for the simple reason that this is an anonymous internet forum and we have no way of confirming that you\'re telling the truth. We\'re a trustworthy bunch – I think the vast majority of people here are who they say they are – but then there was one recent case where a troll did the rounds posting lengthy answers prefaced by claims to have a PhD in [everything from Roman architecture to optometry](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1zbbol/youre_playing_a_dangerous_game_costco/cfs8x4f?context=1). By providing sources that anyone can use to confirm what you say, we don\'t need to rely on trust alone.

Is it unrealistic for him to be flying?
And how far, in advance, could one purchase a ticket for a flight in 1968?
Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

The technological asymmetry between a modern warship and a frigate like the *Constitution* doesn\'t require much elaboration. A modern ship is faster, possesses much more firepower, and is so well armored as to be effectively impervious to the *Constitution*\'s armaments. This is because it has engines where the *Constitution* has only sail, modern guns where the *Constitution* has cannon, and steel armor where the *Constitution* just has wood.

Comparing the *Vasa* to the *Constitution*, however, I realized that I don\'t know what technological developments separate the two. They\'re both made of thick oak, are powered by sail, and field heavy cannon. Given the 170 years between the two, the *Constitution* would kind of have to come out the victor, but I don\'t know if the victory would be as lopsided as the hypothetical battle between the frigate and a modern ship.  Hence my question. How did warship construction, battle tactics, armaments, etc. advance between ~1600 and ~1800? Did the paradigm change as much as it did between ~1800 and ~2000? **To what extent would the *Constitution* outmatch a ship of roughly two centuries prior, and what would be the deciding factors?**

So, this should be pretty awesome. Gathered here today are some of the finest experts on early Judaism and Christianity that the land of Reddit has to offer. Besides some familiar faces from /r/AskHistorians, you\'ll see some new faces – experts from /r/AcademicBiblical who have been temporarily granted flair here. 

Our combined expertise pretty much runs the gamut of all things relevant to the origins and evolution of Judaism and Christianity: from the wider ancient Near Eastern background from which the earliest Israelite religion emerged (including archaeology, as well as the relevant Semitic languages – from Akkadian to Hebrew to Aramaic), to the text and context of the Hebrew Bible, all the way down to the birth of Christianity in the 1st century: including the writings of the New Testament and its Graeco-Roman context – and beyond to the post-Biblical period: the early church fathers, Rabbinic Judaism, and early Christian apocrypha (e.g. the so-called “Gnostic” writings), etc. 

______

I\'m sure this hardly needs to be said, but...we\'re here, first and foremost, as *historians and scholars* of Judaism and Christianity. These are fields of study in which impartial, peer-reviewed academic research is done, just like any other area of the humanities. While there may be questions that are relevant to modern theology – perhaps something like “which Biblical texts can elucidate the modern Christian theological concept of the [so-called \'fate of the unevangelized\'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate_of_the_unlearned), and what was their original context?” – we\'re here today to address things based only on our knowledge of *academic research* and the *history of* Judaism and Christianity. 

____

All that being said, onto to the good stuff. Here\'s our panel of esteemed scholars taking part today, and their backgrounds:

- /u/ReligionProf has a Ph.D. in New Testament Studies from Durham University. He\'s written several books, including a monograph on the Gospel of John published by Cambridge University Press; and he\'s published articles in major journals and edited volumes. Several of these focus on Christian and Jewish apocrypha – he has a particular interest in Mandaeism – and he\'s also one of the most popular bloggers on the internet who focuses on religion/early Christianity.

- /u/narwhal_ has an M.A. in New Testament, Early Christianity and Jewish Studies from Harvard University; and his expertise is similarly as broad as his degree title. He\'s published several scholarly articles, and has made some excellent contributions to /r/AskHistorians and elsewhere.

- /u/TurretOpera has an M.Div and Th.M from Princeton Theological Seminary, where he did his thesis on Paul\'s use of the Psalms. His main area of interest is in the New Testament and early church fathers; he has expertise in Koine Greek, and he also dabbles in Second Temple Judaism.

- /u/husky54 is in his final year of Ph.D. coursework, highly involved in the study of the Hebrew Bible, and is specializing in Northwest Semitic epigraphy and paleography, as well as state formation in the ancient Near East – with early Israelite religion as an important facet of their research. 

- /u/gingerkid1234 is one of our newly-christened mods here at /r/AskHistorians, and has a particular interest in the history of Jewish law and liturgy, as well as expertise in the relevant languages (Hebrew, etc.). His AskHistorians profile, with links to questions he\'s previously answered, can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/gingerkid1234).

- /u/captainhaddock has broad expertise in the areas of Canaanite/early Israelite history and religion, as well as early Christianity – and out of all the people on /r/AcademicBiblical, he\'s probably made the biggest contribution in terms of ongoing scholarly dialogue there.

- I\'m /u/koine_lingua. My interests/areas of expertise pretty much run the gamut of early Jewish and Christian literature: from the relationship between early Biblical texts and Mesopotamian literature, to the noncanonical texts of the Dead Sea Scrolls and other apocrypha (the book of Enoch, etc.), to most facets of early Christianity. One area that I\'ve done a large amount of work in is *eschatology*, from its origins through to the 2nd century CE – as well as just, more broadly speaking, in reconstructing the origins and history of the earliest Christianity. My /r/AskHistorians profile, with a link to the majority of my more detailed answers, can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/koine_lingua). Also, I created and am a main contributor to /r/AcademicBiblical.

- /u/Flubb is another familiar (digital) face from /r/AskHistorians. He specializes in ancient Near Eastern archaeology, intersecting with early Israelite history. Also, he can sing and dance a bit.

- /u/brojangles has a degree in Religion, and is also one of the main contributors to /r/AcademicBiblical, on all sorts of matters pertaining to Judaism and Christianity. He\'s particularly interested in Christian origins, New Testament historical criticism, and has a background in Greek and Latin. 

- /u/SF2K01 won\'t be able to make it until sundown on the east coast – but he has an M.A. in Ancient Jewish History (more specifically focusing on so-called “classical” Judaism) from Yeshiva University, having worked under several *fine* scholars. He\'s one of our resident experts on Rabbinic Judaism; and, well, just a ton of things relating to early Judaism.

My &lt;a href="/r/AskHistorians"&gt;/r/AskHistorians&lt;/a&gt; profile, with a link to the majority of my more detailed answers, can be found &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/koine_lingua"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Also, I created and am a main contributor to &lt;a href="/r/AcademicBiblical"&gt;/r/AcademicBiblical&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/u/Flubb"&gt;/u/Flubb&lt;/a&gt; is another familiar (digital) face from &lt;a href="/r/AskHistorians"&gt;/r/AskHistorians&lt;/a&gt;. He specializes in ancient Near Eastern archaeology, intersecting with early Israelite history. Also, he can sing and dance a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/u/brojangles"&gt;/u/brojangles&lt;/a&gt; has a degree in Religion, and is also one of the main contributors to &lt;a href="/r/AcademicBiblical"&gt;/r/AcademicBiblical&lt;/a&gt;, on all sorts of matters pertaining to Judaism and Christianity. He&amp;#39;s particularly interested in Christian origins, New Testament historical criticism, and has a background in Greek and Latin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/u/SF2K01"&gt;/u/SF2K01&lt;/a&gt; won&amp;#39;t be able to make it until sundown on the east coast – but he has an M.A. in Ancient Jewish History (more specifically focusing on so-called “classical” Judaism) from Yeshiva University, having worked under several &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; scholars. He&amp;#39;s one of our resident experts on Rabbinic Judaism; and, well, just a ton of things relating to early Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

'text' => 'At the end of the Revolutionary War, George Washington surrendered his commission to Congress and returned to civilian life. He has been praised for his actions by both contemporaries and descendants, as one who set the basis for American democracy, rather than use his military power to proclaim himself King of the United States.

However, in the political and social realities of Revolution-era America, could such a proclamation have an even remote chance of success?

The states, both before and during the revolution, had a long tradition of decentralized power and mistrust of central authority. They limited both the power they delegated to Congress (and the Continental Army) as well as the finances needed to pay troops and buy supplies, to the extent that even during wartime Washington had famous troubles securing even the most basic necessities for his troops.

Once the war against the British was over, most troops would be eager to return to their homes. If it came to a choice, many would feel greater allegiance to their home state than to Washington. A proclamation of a military coup would pit Washington against both Congress and State power. If the States and Congress declared Washington an outlaw, withdrew funding, and ordered their troops to return to their home states (from where they could organize local militia resistance, and ensure no tax money would reach Washington to use as war funds) what power base would Washington in fact, have? This is to say nothing of the lack of perceived legitimacy Washington would have in his claim.

In short, did Washington ever have a real chance of seizing power (should have he wanted it), or was his resignation as much a product of inevitability as well as his (acknowledgly authentic) desire to transfer power peacefully?

How much of the premise of "Washington could have become King if he chose to" a product of looking at American history through a European contemporary lens (where, due to different historical, economic, social, and political realities, it was far more feasible for a successful general to seize power, such as was the case with Napoleon). Alternatively, how much of Washington\'s peaceful surrender of power is part of the American Foundation epos, akin to that of Cincinnatus during the early Roman Republic, rather than (again) being based in contemporary reality of the Thirteen Colonies?

**Note:** I realize the topic and phrasing of this qusetion may come close to a "What If" question, which was not my intent. I was trying to frame the question as "was this option ever a feasible reality to Washington, something that he (or other contemporaries or historians) have in fact considered and analyzed", rather than "let\'s discuss the alternate reality when that actually happened". If this question is still disallowed due to this rule, I apologize in advance.',

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never heard of any triumphs for their defeat, monuments to its success or even the name of the Iberian leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

This summer is the 70th anniversary of 1945, which makes it the anniversary of the first nuclear test, Trinity (July 16th), the bombing of Hiroshima (August 6th), the bombing of Nagasaki (August 9th), and the eventual end of World War II. As a result, I thought it would be appropriate to do an AMA on the subject of the **Manhattan Project**, the name for the overall wartime Allied effort to develop and use the first atomic bombs. 

The scope of this AMA should be primarily constrained to questions and events connected with the wartime effort, though if you want to stray into areas of the German atomic program, or the atomic efforts that predated the establishment of the Manhattan Engineer District, or the question of what happened in the near postwar to people or places connected with the wartime work (e.g. the Oppenheimer affair, the Rosenberg trial), that would be fine by me. 

If you\'re just wrapping your head around the topic, Wikipedia\'s [Timeline of the Manhattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Manhattan_Project) is a nice place to start for a quick chronology. 

For questions that I have answered at length on my blog, I may just give a TLDR; version and then link to the blog. This is just in the interest of being able to answer as many questions as possible. Feel free to ask follow-up questions. 

About me: [I am a professional historian of science, with several fancy degrees,](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/about-me/) who specializes in the history of nuclear weapons, particularly the attempted uses of secrecy (knowledge control) to control the spread of technology (proliferation). I teach at an engineering school in Hoboken, New Jersey, [right on the other side of the Hudson River from Manhattan](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Stevens-Institute-of-Technology.jpg). 

I am the creator of Reddit\'s beloved online nuclear weapons simulator, [NUKEMAP](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap) (which recently surpassed 50 million virtual "detonations," having been used by over 10 million people worldwide), and the author of _[Restricted Data: The Nuclear Secrecy Blog](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com)_, a place for my ruminations about nuclear history. I am working on a book about nuclear secrecy from the Manhattan Project through the War on Terror, under contract with the University of Chicago Press.

I am also the historical consultant for the second season of the television show _[MANH(A)TTAN](http://wgnamerica.com/series/Manhattan)_, which is a fictional film noir story set in the environs and events of the Manhattan Project, and airs on WGN America this fall (the first season [is available](http://www.hulu.com/manhattan) on Hulu Plus). I am on the Advisory Committee of the [Atomic Heritage Foundation](http://atomicheritage.org), which was the group that has spearheaded the Manhattan Project National Historic Park effort, which was passed into law last year by President Obama. (As an aside, the AHF\'s site [Voices of the Manhattan Project](http://www.manhattanprojectvoices.org/) is an amazing collection of oral histories connected to this topic.)

Last week I had an article on the Trinity test appear on [The New Yorker\'s _Elements_ blog](http://newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-first-light-of-the-trinity-atomic-test) which was pretty damned cool. 

Generic disclaimer: anything I write on here is my own view of things, and not the view of any of my employers or anybody else.

My particular area of expertise is British sailors during the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

AMA about the Royal Navy, international trade, Empire, the power and significance of sailors, exploration, the Mary Rose, yo ho ho and a bottle of rum, Caribbean slavery, and more.

Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could.

Obviously women were not given anything remotely resembling equal footing in the new US government.

'text' => 'Hello dear users!

As I am sure many of you have already heard, today has seen a certain commotion over comments made by a US government official regarding the Nazis, the use of chemical weapons in WWII and the Holocaust. Because recent experience surrounding the comments of Ken Livingstone has shown us at here at this sub that it is likely that we will be see an uptick of questions surrounding this issue, I have decided to preemptively put together some answers and information surrounding these issues.

* *"You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons."*

According to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons "the term chemical weapon may be applied to any toxic chemical or its precursor that can cause death, injury, temporary incapacitation or sensory irritation through its chemical action." This internationally recognized definition of chemical weapons includes many things, from nerve agents like Tabun and Sarin to the more conventional pepper spray and CS gas. It also includes poison and other gas, both famously used by Nazi Germany to kill millions of people.

The utilization of gas as a means of mass killing has in fact become so strongly related to the Nazis and their policies that it as well as the used gas chambers have become by now almost synonymous with the Holocaust and other Nazi mass crimes, even despite the fact that a lot of other means of killing, foremost among them mass-shootings, were also employed by the Nazis.

Historians generally distinguish between four different kinds of mass killings via gas as employed by the Nazis depending on the technical method of killing:

* In the earliest iteration of Nazi mass murder via gassing (1940/41), in the six T4 killing centers (Grafeneck, Brandenburg, Hartheim, Sonnenstein Pirna, Bernburg and Hadamar) the Nazis employed Carbon Monoxide from gas canisters that was funneled into gas chambers. The same methods were also employed during the mass killing of concentration camp inmates unable to work dubbed "Aktion 14f13" and by the so-called Sonderkommando Lange, a special SS and Police unit that used two gas vans with the same method to kill both Polish intellectuals as well as inmates of Polish mental and handicapped institutions around the same time. This method was also later used in the first gas chamber in the Majdank death camp

* In the death camps of Aktion Reinhard (Sobibor, Treblinka, Belzec) as well as in the Chelmno death camp and in the Soviet Union and Serbia, the Nazis used exhaust fumes from a variety of motors to mass-kill people. In the Reinhard Camps, a tank engine was hooked to a funnel that lead into a gas chamber while in Chelmno as well as in Serbia, the USSR and Chelmno especially constructed gas vans were used where with the flip of a switch the driver could funnel the motor exhausts in the back cabin of the van.

* In Auschwitz – most famously – but also in a second gas chamber in Majdanek, the Nazis used Zyklon B,  cyanide-based pesticide invented in Germany in the early 1920s. It was a poisonous gas that interfered with cellular respiration, meaning it\'s victims would effectively suffocate while air was all around them. Zyklon B was also supplied to the considerable smaller gas chambers in Mauthausen, Ravensbrück, and Buchenwald among others.

* The gas chambers in Sachsenhausen and Natzweiler used a different compound that was also based on Hydrogen cyanide or prussic acid as it was called that was liquid.

In these actions combined, the Nazis killed more than 3 million people using gas. The original idea to do so was developed by  Reichsleiter Philipp Bouhler, the chief of Hitler\'s personal Chancellery and Karl Brandt, Hitler\'s personal physician whom Hitler charged in 1939 with designing and carrying out the T4 killing program against handicapped and mentally ill in German institutions. Bouhler and Brandt decided on the use of gas for two reasons: First, they deemed it economical and in line with the mandate that the program should be carried out in secret (it would have been hard to hide mass shootings in Germany) and secondly, they thought that if details of the program would became known to the public, they could at least claim that its victims "peacefully fell asleep".

In reality however, death by Carbon Monoxide poisoning is far from "peacefully falling asleep". Rather, as witnesses to the T4 gassing have described it, death took anywhere from 3 to 15 minutes all the while the victims were shaken by painful cramps and panicked. 

The T4 program and its way of mass killing was what also later lead to a similar method employed in the Aktion Reinhard Camps and with the gas vans. It was in fact the about 500 employees of the T4 killing centers who when the program was stopped due to public outrage got with a delay transferred to the Reinhard Camps, camps designed to kill the Jews of Poland from spring 1942 onward. Because pure Carbon Monoxide in gas canisters was hard to obtain / deliver in occupied Poland, the instead opted to use the tank engines as their source for gas.

The gas vans were originally an idea of the Sonderkommando Lange and while the origin of the first two models is unclear, it is very likely that Lange build them himself. Taking this idea and with the input from the T4/Reinhard personnel, it was the Kriminaltechnische Institut (KTI or Criminal Technological Institute) in Germany that developed the more "refined" versions of the gas vans that were used for mass killing in Chelmno, Serbia and the Soviet Union.

To understand how the use of Zyklon B came around, it is important to understand that the Auschwitz personnel under commandant Rudolf Höss was actually competing with the Reinhard Aktion for who could build the more effective and useful concentration / death camp. Höss and his personnel were looking for more effective and economic ways to mass murder people and after several experiments, including the first gassing in Auschwitz of Soviet POWs, in 1942 they settled on Zyklon B.

Zyklon B as a Hydrogen cyanide has – according to Höss – several advantages over exhaust gasses. Unlike in the reinhard Camps were the tank engines had broken down several times due to over-use, this would not happen with Zyklon B. Also, Höss argued that it generally killed faster. While exhaust gasses could take anywhere from 8 to 18 minutes to kill a gas chamber full of people, Zyklon B was able to cut down this time by about half thus making the time between killing actions shorter and subsequently being able to kill more people per day.

While all this occurred, the use of liquid cyanide in Sachsenhausen was actually experimental in order to find an even more economical and faster way to kill thousands of people daily.

So, in conclusion, the Nazis made extensive use of gasses that fall well within the definition of chemical weapons and killed more than 3 million people using this method.

* *"But what about the use of chemical weapons as part of conventional warfare along the lines of WWI?"*

/u/kojin has answered this question previously on our sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/42nqi1/why_didnt_germany_use_chemical_weapons_during_ww2/). Summing up the findings of the report *he Problem of Chemical and Biological Warfare: A Study of the Historical, Technical, Military, Legal and Political Aspects of CBW, and Possible Disarmament Measures.* published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) (Stockholm, 1971). Vol IV., they have shown that Germany albeit producing gasses such as Sarin and actually inventing Tabun, the German General Staff was not interested in using gasses as part of conventional warfare, wanted to avoid retaliatory attacks, and had generally little in the way of prepartation for the use of gasses in warfare.

As they write:

&gt; In the end German non-use is an interesting case. There were a range of proponents for use at various stages throughout the war with ample opportunity to do so. Much like the other belligerents, Germany certainly had the capacity to at least initiate use on some level throughout the war. However, the a general lack of readiness, materiel constraints, differing priorities, a collection of reluctant actors inside German leadership, and the ever-present threat of retaliation-in-kind proved sufficient to block its introduction.

* *"[Hitler] was not using the gas on his own people"*

This, again, is not true. Of the 240,000 Jews that were still living in Austria and Germany in 1939, 210,000 or about 90% perished in the Holocaust, most of them gassed.

The problem with this statement unfortunately worded as it is, is that it rhetorically – most likely unintentionally - reproduces a  view of the world shared by the Nazis, namely that Jews could not be German. I have written previously about this notion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5t4g7c/why_does_the_term_antisemite_only_apply_to/) and in connection to Hitler [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4b7lgq/how_did_hitler_get_the_idea_that_there_was_a/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5u7w85/ive_read_that_nazis_hate_for_jews_derived_of_the/dds79ms/) and it can be summed up as the view

&gt; that the Jews not only constituted their own "race" but also that they were dangerous and on contrarian terms with the Aryan race, was intended to show that not only was this a new way to understand the world but also to lend themselves scientific credence. Heinrich von Treitschke, who popularized the term "anti-Semitism" in Germany, used it to argue that Jews, no matter how areligious they were and how "German" they had become in the manners how they lived their lives, were always different from the Germans and a danger to the national German character since they, as a people without a homeland, were comparable, in his mind, to parasites undermining "Germanness".

* *"Holocaust centers"*

Yeah, I got nothing here. This was just stepping in it.

'html' => '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello dear users!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am sure many of you have already heard, today has seen a certain commotion over comments made by a US government official regarding the Nazis, the use of chemical weapons in WWII and the Holocaust. Because recent experience surrounding the comments of Ken Livingstone has shown us at here at this sub that it is likely that we will be see an uptick of questions surrounding this issue, I have decided to preemptively put together some answers and information surrounding these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons &amp;quot;the term chemical weapon may be applied to any toxic chemical or its precursor that can cause death, injury, temporary incapacitation or sensory irritation through its chemical action.&amp;quot; This internationally recognized definition of chemical weapons includes many things, from nerve agents like Tabun and Sarin to the more conventional pepper spray and CS gas. It also includes poison and other gas, both famously used by Nazi Germany to kill millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The utilization of gas as a means of mass killing has in fact become so strongly related to the Nazis and their policies that it as well as the used gas chambers have become by now almost synonymous with the Holocaust and other Nazi mass crimes, even despite the fact that a lot of other means of killing, foremost among them mass-shootings, were also employed by the Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historians generally distinguish between four different kinds of mass killings via gas as employed by the Nazis depending on the technical method of killing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the earliest iteration of Nazi mass murder via gassing (1940/41), in the six T4 killing centers (Grafeneck, Brandenburg, Hartheim, Sonnenstein Pirna, Bernburg and Hadamar) the Nazis employed Carbon Monoxide from gas canisters that was funneled into gas chambers. The same methods were also employed during the mass killing of concentration camp inmates unable to work dubbed &amp;quot;Aktion 14f13&amp;quot; and by the so-called Sonderkommando Lange, a special SS and Police unit that used two gas vans with the same method to kill both Polish intellectuals as well as inmates of Polish mental and handicapped institutions around the same time. This method was also later used in the first gas chamber in the Majdank death camp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the death camps of Aktion Reinhard (Sobibor, Treblinka, Belzec) as well as in the Chelmno death camp and in the Soviet Union and Serbia, the Nazis used exhaust fumes from a variety of motors to mass-kill people. In the Reinhard Camps, a tank engine was hooked to a funnel that lead into a gas chamber while in Chelmno as well as in Serbia, the USSR and Chelmno especially constructed gas vans were used where with the flip of a switch the driver could funnel the motor exhausts in the back cabin of the van.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Auschwitz – most famously – but also in a second gas chamber in Majdanek, the Nazis used Zyklon B,  cyanide-based pesticide invented in Germany in the early 1920s. It was a poisonous gas that interfered with cellular respiration, meaning it&amp;#39;s victims would effectively suffocate while air was all around them. Zyklon B was also supplied to the considerable smaller gas chambers in Mauthausen, Ravensbrück, and Buchenwald among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gas chambers in Sachsenhausen and Natzweiler used a different compound that was also based on Hydrogen cyanide or prussic acid as it was called that was liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these actions combined, the Nazis killed more than 3 million people using gas. The original idea to do so was developed by  Reichsleiter Philipp Bouhler, the chief of Hitler&amp;#39;s personal Chancellery and Karl Brandt, Hitler&amp;#39;s personal physician whom Hitler charged in 1939 with designing and carrying out the T4 killing program against handicapped and mentally ill in German institutions. Bouhler and Brandt decided on the use of gas for two reasons: First, they deemed it economical and in line with the mandate that the program should be carried out in secret (it would have been hard to hide mass shootings in Germany) and secondly, they thought that if details of the program would became known to the public, they could at least claim that its victims &amp;quot;peacefully fell asleep&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality however, death by Carbon Monoxide poisoning is far from &amp;quot;peacefully falling asleep&amp;quot;. Rather, as witnesses to the T4 gassing have described it, death took anywhere from 3 to 15 minutes all the while the victims were shaken by painful cramps and panicked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion, the Nazis made extensive use of gasses that fall well within the definition of chemical weapons and killed more than 3 million people using this method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

It deals with simultaneous equations and with equations of **degrees as high as fourteen."**

A main takeaway I get from this article is that Chinese mathematics was not motivated by the beauty of mathematics or its theory (most things were left unproven), but by purely practical concerns of astronomy and engineering. What practical problem warranted a 14th degree equation?

Bonus: Do we know how much paper it would take and how long somebody could take calculating such a thing?

Were the Canadian colonies ever considered to be "American" colonies? Was Canada considered just a region, like New England or the Middle Colonies?

When the Rebels referred to the "13 Colonies" was this only after it was clear that no one else was joining or were the 13 always distinct "American" entities, viewed as foreign to the "Canadian" ones?

**Edit:** I have read some on the reasons that the Canadian colonies didn\'t join and I feel like I understand their reasons. What I\'m trying to get at specifically, was whether before the Revolution how foreign would the American Colonies view the Canadians?

From 24 December 1944 until about a month later she was stationed in Christianstadt/Bober (present-day Krzystkowice, Poland). In this town the Christianstadt concentration camp was located. This was a satellite camp of KZ Groß-Rosen where women were forced to work for a chemical factory.

My grandmother never spoke about her experiences during the war and died in 1998.  She was arrested after the war but not sentenced to any jail time - maybe she wasn\'t put on trial at all. Her court records show she went to Germany but not what she actually *did* there.

It just doesn\'t make sense to me. Personally, if I\'m going to buy a product, I want to think that having the product will make me feel happier than not having it.

Most kinds of products other than fashion have typically used pictures of people who are smiling and look like they are happy to have that product. That\'s something I can relate to and makes me want to buy the product.

I realize that modeling may not be the happiest of professions, but I have to think that it\'s not just the models themselves who are so unhappy - they must be instructed to give this look.

Why do they do this? Was it always this way, or was there an earlier time when models looked happier? If there was, who started the sour face trend?',

Did the wartime photographers or the US Military edit out the frames that were too graphic for the public to see?  Did the photographers not roll the camera when things got too hot? Maybe I’m not watching the right videos… Can anybody explain?',

Medea extract

Of all creatures that have life and reason  
we women are the sorriest lot:   
first we must at a great expenditure of money   
buy a husband and even take on a master   
over our body: this evil is more galling than the first.   
Here is the most challenging contest, whether we will get a bad man  
or a good one. Besides, divorce is unsavory   
for a woman and it is not possible to say no to one\'s husband.   
And when she comes into new customs and rules   
a woman must be a prophet of what she could never learn at home:   
how best to deal with her marriage partner;  
and if we get it worked out well and a husband shares   
our life with us, and he bears the yoke without violence,   
life is to be envied. Otherwise we are better off dead.   
But the man, when he is bored with things at home   
he can go out to ease the weariness of his heart.  
But we have just one person to look to.   
They say that we live a life free of danger   
at home while they face battle with the spear.   
How wrong they are. I would rather stand three times  
in the line of battle than once bear a child. ',

However, this often results in a tempo so fast it\'s physically unplayable, which is problematic. The alternative "double beat" view interprets historical metronome numbers as effectively two times slower. This in turn often results in a tempo which is shockingly slow to a modern audience. The "double beat" theory was proposed in 1974 by Erich Schwandt and more recently elaborated by Lorenz Gadient ("Sekunde, Takt und Pendelschlag", https://www.jstor.org/stable/25162336), but many authors that hold the mainstream view, such as Klaus Miehling in his book "Das Tempo in der Musik von Barock und Vorklassik", argue against the "double beat" theory.

What was the extent of his psychological wounds after 1755, and how did they affect his ability to rule the Empire? It\'s hard to believe that the trauma of stone buildings was the only scar he carried with him that affected his behavior.

Edit: I\'ve been thinking that the weirdness of his trauma of stone buildings might not be understood by people from some countries. To be clear, in Portugal the vast majority of buildings were built with stone, from the palaces and cathedrals to the homes of peasants. To avoid living in a stone palace, he had to build one made of wood, such a weird thing for the Portuguese that they called it the "Royal Shack" (Real Barraca). It burned down a few years after he died.

For those who have not seen it,  the movie follows a New York cop trapped in a LA skyscraper on Christmas Eve facing down highly sophisticated terrorist hostage-takers turned thieves. In the second act the police and eventually the FBI get involved and the film seems to go out of it\'s way to mock the apparently standard procedures used by law enforcement during the siege that ensues. 

&amp;#x200B;

First the LA SWAT team is rebuffed, but only after showing one of the officers snag a finger on a thorn while walking through a bush, derisively juxtaposing the officer\'s apparent hardcore role on the SWAT team to his concern for a minor irritation. From there police operations escalate, leading to an exploded APC and the FBI overriding local government to cut power to a dozen city blocks, ultimately enabling the antagonist\'s plan to open an electromagnetically locked safe. All the while police leadership is shown as incompetent, arrogant, and contemptuous of the protagonist\'s actions to successfully contain the hostage-takers. The police response culminates with the FBI calling in helicopter gunships to attack the terrorists in a vain attempt to crush the opposition.

&amp;#x200B;

The writers and director of Die Hard obviously used these plot elements to heighten the opposition facing the hero of the movie; after all, he wouldn\'t be much of a hero if he could be rescued by an effective police response. However, I couldn\'t help thinking about the similarities between these plot elements and the infamous law enforcement embarrassments of Ruby Ridge and the Waco siege: incompetent leadership, underestimated opposition, and a disastrous final assault. I initially thought those specific plot points weren\'t quite \'ripped from the headlines\' but at least inspired by those events, but Die Hard was released in 1988 while Ruby Ridge and Waco didn\'t occur until 1992 and 1993. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question then is if these similarities were just coincidence or were there larger undercurrents of anti-Federal/anti-centralization feeling swirling before 1992 that the screenwriters tapped into?',

&gt; Who\'s got a job for a general
&gt; When he stops being a general?
&gt; They all get a job but a general no one hires
&gt; They fill his chest with medals while he\'s across the foam
&gt; And they spread the crimson carpet when he comes marching home
&gt; The next day someone hollers when he comes into view
&gt; "Here comes the general" and they all say "General who?"
&gt; They\'re delighted that he came
&gt; But they can\'t recall his name
&gt; Nobody thinks of assigning him
&gt; When they stop wining and dining him

&gt; So many one and two and three and four star generals
&gt; Unemployed

-Irving Berlin

                'html' => '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visited Auschwitz and took the guided tour. It was a really powerful experience. When we visited the location where the gas chambers were located, the guide told us that some of the condemned knew or suspected what was about to happen to them. Instead of begging for their lives, they changed/prayed or sang together in a group as an act of faith/bravery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never heard about this before, and I honestly teared up at that point in the tour. I have tried to find sources to confirm this information, but I have been unsuccessful.

But even then, there are some who go above and beyond to stand out even here, and although there are still far more examples of that than we can reasonably recognize, these awards at least can give some well deserved laurels to a few of the people who have helped to make 2018 another great year of AskHistorians.

I\'m going to start out with the one that, out of all other awards handed out, is perhaps the most justly due. We have run our "Excellence in Flairdom" award for over a year, intending to recognize flaired users who helped make the sub a better place through *more* than just answering questions, but through giving to the community, but this year we have decided to award a deluxe edition Excellence in Flairdom award for the year as a whole. We’re not just giving; we _invented_ this award for /u/itsallfolklore. For years now, IAF has been one of the warmest, most steadfast, smartest, and most quietly fun presences on AskHistorians. If you only read their posts for “facts,” you miss their real lesson—history is a story, history is infinite stories, and we are storytellers. Well, IAF is the master storyteller, whether it’s the folk, the diaries, or their own oral histories. For many of us in the flair community, itsallfolklore has also been an amazing and understanding mentor (consciously or not). It’s not an accident that one of the most-repeated lines in mod discussions is, “*I want to be IAF when I grow up.*” Now that we have sufficiently embarrassed them, we will close by saying thank you, and here it is: Excellence in Flairdom Award 2018: Historian, Storyteller, Mentor, Friend.

-----------------

Next up is the \'[Users\' Choice Awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/acwxmv/look_over_here_it_is_the_askhistorians_best_of/)\', the Vox Populi. 

And I must say, it is nice to know that you all are just as crazy about IAF as we are. The first place Users\' Choice Award I\'m pleased to announce goes to /u/itsallfolklore for their answer to the question ["Is there a way to study history in an unbiased manner? If so, how?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/aa3qsn/is_there_a_way_to_study_history_in_an_unbiased), asked by /u/bidric, which was as enlightening and entertaining as we could hope for, but easily par for the course when it comes to him.

The second Users\' Choice Award goes to /u/Bentresh! They were able to really sink their teeth into the question ["I\'m playing Assassins Creed, and frankly, the crocodiles are really irritating me. How did actual ancient Egyptians deal with it?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8oujz5/im_playing_assassins_creed_and_frankly_the/e0724ro/), asked by [deleted], and give a little depth to the history behind the game!

Taking that third User\'s Choice Award was /u/dhmontgomery. Their wonderful answer to ["How true is this claim: "...in 1789, 50 percent of the French people did not speak [French] at all, and only 12 to 13 percent spoke it fairly well"?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7u8oyk/how_true_is_this_claim_in_1789_50_percent_of_the/dtj3h5u/), asked by /u/Nessie, might have passed under the radar back in January, but its getting well deserved recognition now!

Finally, for the Dark Horse Award in the user vote, recognizing a non-flaired contributor, /u/sickhobbit scored the honors for their answer to ["Between 1945 and 1949, the Netherlands and Indonesia went to war over Indonesian independence. US and British forces were involved, and there were approx 200,000 casualties, before Indonesia finally prevailed. Why is this conflict so obscure? What were the consequences in East Asia?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8f2ctv/between_1945_and_1949_the_netherlands_and/dy08hk0/?context=3), asked by /u/ajbrown141.

------------------

Now for the \'Flairs\' Choice Awards\', voted on specifically by the members of our panel. 

First up here is /u/drylaw, who is being recognized for their work on ["The greatest treasure of the Aztec empire was taken by Cortez, but then captured by the pirate Jean Fleury, who presented the riches to the king of France. What happened to those treasures afterward?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8h33kd/the_greatest_treasure_of_the_aztec_empire_was/dyhemwu/?context=3), asked by peace-monger.

Taking the second Flairs\' Choice, and no stranger to this podium, is /u/mikedash, who earned his prize this year with ["What was the nature of the government of Barawa? Was it unique in the Swahili coast? Was it a republic, and if so, how did it compare to contemperary governments in Europe?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8x7ciu/what_was_the_nature_of_the_government_of_barawa/e2du9xx/?context=3), asked by  Ana_Gramm.

And finally to round out this podium is /u/400-rabbits who gave us some excellent insight into the question ["What would it have been like to grow up as a girl in the Aztec Empire pre-colonialism?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8y9517/what_would_it_have_been_like_to_grow_up_as_a_girl/e2dz3kw/?context=3), asked by /u/AnnalsPornographie.

For the \'Dark Horse\' Award in the Flair vote, it isn\'t surprising to see perennial winner /u/Erusian once again taking a bow, nor it is surprising that it would be their answer to ["Was John Cleese correct, in 1972, when his character famously exclaimed that cheddar cheese was the most popular cheese in the world?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9lnuap/was_john_cleese_correct_in_1972_when_his/e7afmki/?context=3), asked by /u/ZeMoose, that is most fondly remembered.

------------------------

Closing out our ceremony, finally, is the \'Greatest Question Award\', which goes to /u/IphisofCrete for their question ["The Stonewall Riots are generally considered the beginning of the modern LGBT rights movement, but gay rights groups had existed long before 1969. What made the post-Stonewall revolution so impactful and what changed to make gay rights movements more cohesive and vocal?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9feqvn/the_stonewall_riots_are_generally_considered_the/), which might have gone unanswered the first time, but did get that helpful boost to get a fantastic response from /u/sunagainstgold [on the second try](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9m9wb8/2nd_time_the_stonewall_riots_are_generally/).


------------------

So there we have it! Your 2018 honorees. Let me be the first to congratulate them all, and thank them for their part in a wonderful year.

As always, winners will be getting some well deserved "reddit Premium", and - *fingers crosses* - some fancy /r/AskHistorians swag in the mail once the Admins finish updating their licensing agreement.',

&lt;p&gt;Every year, thousands of users contribute amazing content to &lt;a href="/r/AskHistorians"&gt;/r/AskHistorians&lt;/a&gt;, and each and every one of them deserves recognition for the part that they play in making this such an incredible community, as do those of you asking questions, upvoting great content, or simply reading and enjoying what gets produced here every day.

Proponents of this claim often point to painting (e.g. Degas, Rubens, Titian) or old celebrities like Marilyn Monroe (although her measurements were 35-22-35!).

A popular explanation for this is that in the past, being fat was associated with being rich, and that this association with wealth made plumpness part of the beauty standard of the day. (I\'ve heard this claim made about pretty much every period from the Hellenic period to the Victorian era). The reasoning behind this claim is that rich people ate a lot and didn\'t have to expend energy toiling in the fields or doing other manual labor. Since eating well and not expending energy doesn\'t tend to make one thin, the argument is that being (relatively) fat was a sign of wealth and thus part of the beauty standard of the time. 

The corollary to this explanation is that today, being slim is seen as beautiful because it\'s associated with wealth. Once again, the reasoning is that in order to be slim you need to have time to work out and money to afford healthy food, and having time and money means you\'re wealthy (or at least well off). 

I\'m curious as to whether the assumption of this claim (female beauty standards have gone from prizing plump women to thin women) is true, but /u/chocolatepot has addressed that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4e8c52/did_heavier_men_and_women_used_to_be_considered/), so I\'m more interested in whether the explanation (that Western society values body types *because* they are correlated with wealth) is true.

Together my books overturn two myths: the first is that high rates of mortality led to cold and aloof relationships between family members in the premodern period. The second myth is that before the birth of modern medicine, most illnesses left you either dead or disabled.

In the lead up to the publication of Misery to Mirth, [I spent 9 days tweeting as Alice Thornton](https://twitter.com/17thcenturymum/status/1002134623151886336) about the serious illness of her daughter Nally. I [used real diary entries](https://blogs.reading.ac.uk/irhs/tweeting-from-the-grave-sickness-and-survival-in-the-17th-century/) from Alice and other parents to bring to life the personal experience of illness in early modern England, from the dual perspectives of children and their loved ones.

Ask me anything about what it was like to be ill, or to witness the illness of a loved one, in early modern England (c.1580-1720). This might include medical treatments &amp; prayer, emotions &amp; spiritual feelings, pain &amp; suffering, death or survival, recovery &amp; convalescence, family &amp; childhood, etc.  My academic research includes public engagement with children through interactive workshops.

From what I\'ve seen, ergonomics started to be a focus in the 20th century (through the term was coined in the 1800s). It seems the studies were also focused more on factory and manual workers until after WWII.

I\'m wondering though about the people who had desk jobs before then. In Europe I got to see work desks and chairs used by anyone from monastic scribes to nobles.

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I should add that I asked this question on 
&lt;a href="/r/asklatinamerica"&gt;r/asklatinamerica&lt;/a&gt; before, it looks like I got one response from somebody that was shadowbanned. Both gave an answer that I know to be false and that is “black people were just as poor and treated just as poorly as everybody else”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that this is false, unless the “everybody else” only includes the native groups. Until around 1950, Cosa Rica has Jim Crowe style segregation laws that only allowed Afro-Costa Ricans to live in the Provence of Limón. Afro-Brazilians earn less money than white Brazilians (my wife is Brazilian so I know more about Brazilian race relations than I do about other countries in Latin America). I visited Cartagena Colombia with my wife. We went to a beach on the island of Barú and I was shocked to see that I was the only black person that was actually there on vacation. I could go on but you get the point that I’m trying to make. &lt;/p&gt;

- Did other Nazis share this sentiment or was it all Hitler?

- Did the Nazis actually believe that Natives posed enough of a force in the United States to destabilize the government?

The story is more about how Br’er Rabbit escapes once captured, but the capturing itself is entirely incidental. Why the hell would the story include such a specific and improbable trap?

Looking it up, it looks like “Tar babies” are involved in multiple stories across multiple cultures. Early stories are found in India and Iran, but Native Americans and, of course, American slaves have the same bizarre story element? Why is “Tar baby” such a common trope?

On the [Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar-Baby), it is noted that *The Journal of American Folklore* examines **267 Tar Baby stories**. Why are there so many? 

Is this as unusual as I think it is?

\\^\\^\\^\\^  I\'m struggling to phrase this part right.  Those defeats are obviously outliers that wiped out veteran troops but what was the attrition rate like in quieter periods?

Would there have been a level of success that a legion could have where the state would actually not be able to afford to provide land to the sheer amount of surviving veterans? Would the conquering of new lands have always balanced this out? Did the land grants have any influence on the amount of expansion and conquering that Rome was involved in?

If there was a strain put on the state in providing land would there have ever been an attempt by the Senate to throw specific veteran units into campaigns where they could be assured of having a number of troops killed, thereby lessening the burden?

I\'m not sure what time frame to put on this to get the best answers. Wikipedia mentions that the legions became mostly comprised of barabrian troops by the time of  Diocletian. So I think I should specify from the time of the reforms (105BC to circa 200AD.

This tended to follow my minuscule knowledge beforehand sorting him into a sorta robin hood bandit.

however, I was reading his wikipedia article, and it mentioned Villa used widespread rape and sexual violence. They suggested his womanizing persona was incorrect and his plethora of wives were not necessarily  willing. 

included as well is an event called the gang rape of Namiquipa. Where Villa herded women into animal pins and had his men gangrape them to death. 

This took me aback, as that seemed to heavily conflict with the popular view of Villa. I haven\'t been able to find any good sources for this gangrape, or any other good accounts covering this aspect of Villa.

Is this account accurate? Did Villa let his men rape widely or is this propaganda from the era? And if he did was this just base cruelty towards women or did use this as a military tactic? Either to reward his men or punish the enemy? 

Thank you in advance!

* The code in those books. I don\'t know what software design was like at the time--was it written in a particular language? What was the code responsible for? "Navigation" seems so broad. Did it react to certain inputs? Was it just a sequence to time thrusters with hard-coded calculations?

## Found nazi badges in a box of my grandparents stuff, not sure what’s real, what’s not

📷

Cleaning my parents garage, I come across a box of my grandparents stuff from around when they were married (1948). Entire box is filled with letters, boxes, random stuff dated between 46-51.

Among the items in there were these badges, arm band and flags(?). There are no grand parents alive to confirm/ give context and no one I knew about on that side of the family fought in ww2 in the euro theater (had an uncle who was a mechanic in pacific theater).

For those of you who may not have seen my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a3p1ig/meta_i_wrote_my_phd_dissertation_on_askhistorians/), my name is Sarah Gilbert, and I wrote half of my dissertation on AskHistorians. For those of you who are interested in checking it out, it can be accessed [here](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0372890). I\'ve written three posts highlighting some of my findings and this is the second. 

In the last post I briefly touched on challenges associated with sharing knowledge in AskHistorians. In this post I’m going to address what I see as a major source of those challenges (and others): the divergence of reddit\'s norms from those of AskHistorians, and the technical features of reddit that enable, and even exacerbate, these challenges. As with the previous post, before I get into the details of the cultural and technical impacts of reddit on AskHistorians I’m going discuss aspects of my own experiences on reddit that impact this work.  

**Positionality**

The [prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a3p1ig/meta_i_wrote_my_phd_dissertation_on_askhistorians/) provided a brief overview on the methodology I used in my dissertation work. Since this post is long and the data sources and analysis are the same, I’m not going to include that information again. However, my position relative to the work shared in this post is a bit different. To recap, [positionality](https://weingartenlrc.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/research-writing-whats-your-positionality/) is a process undertaken by qualitative researchers so that they can be more aware of and attempt to mitigate biases that might come from demographic characteristics and lived experiences. I have both demographic characteristics and lived experiences that influence how I’ve framed this post, and even the fact that I chose to write it. As a woman user of a site that hosts misogynistic communities, I identified with the experiences of other women and felt a great deal of empathy towards participants who were affected by sexism, racism, and bigotry. While my identity as a woman likely led to some bias, I believe that, overall, my experiences as a reddit user played a positive role in conducting research in this space. Truth be told, metasubs are my guilty pleasure, and I find controversy that relates to reddit itself fascinating. I have a good idea of how reddit and its culture has developed over the years because I was there (since 2012 anyway), with metaphoric popcorn, as many of these developments unfolded. Much of this post was not written as an outsider looking in, but as a reddit user (and AskHistorians reader) myself. 

This post is organized in three main parts: first I provide an overview of AskHistorians’ norms and describe how these norms establish the sub as a public history site. Next, I provide an historical overview of reddit’s norms, primarily as they pertain to speech. Finally, I describe how reddit’s norms and technology are both problematic and advantageous for AskHistorians as a public history site.  

**The development of AskHistorians as a public history site**

A common joke made in meta posts (usually on AskHistorians’ birthday or in reference to the 20-year moratorium) goes something like this: “so in x years will someone write the history of AskHistorians?!” It’s a good joke– however, an early history of AskHistorians has already been written by u/agentdcf in [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/682ta1/friday_freeforall_april_28_2017/dgv7zhf/). It’s fascinating and I recommend everyone take a look. 

However, for those who might want to avoid falling down an AskHistorians rabbit hole, the takeaways from his post that are most relevant here are: 

* For the first six months AskHistorians was, for all intents and purposes, lawless: flair was awarded based on an honor system; rules weren’t formalized, at least not in writing; answers often veered from the topic of the question; norms developed so that answers were long, detailed, and well sourced; and moderation was light, relying on users to enforce community norms through voting. 
* In 2012 the sub underwent a fast period of growth: those who appreciated the long, detailed, and well sourced answers began to share them on aggregation subs like DepthHub and BestOf, which drew traffic and subscribers (side note: this is how and when I found AskHistorians). Between March and May of that year, AskHistorians began its ‘Eternal September.’ 
* Rapid growth necessitated change: The influx of new users meant that not all of them enculturated existing norms on their own. This led to the development of rules to formalize these norms, and the establishment of a mod team to enforce them. 

So, while the strict set of rules we know to today weren’t established from the beginning, many (such as providing in-depth, well-sourced answers; avoiding jokes; and maintaining civility) existed informally though the norms of the community right from the beginning. It’s also these rules and norms that allow AskHistorians to function as a public history site. 

What is public history? According to The National Council on Public History, public history is defined as “history beyond the walls of the traditional classroom” (n.d.). I’m in no position to go into more depth about what is, or isn’t public history, as that’s not my area of expertise. However, in our interview u/mimicofmodes described why AskHistorians stands out as a public history site: 

&gt;. . . it\'s the most direct method of public history out there. At a living history site you have site interpreters . . . between the public and the curators/researchers; a book is a one-way street, as is a museum exhibition, whether the recipient is passively taking the information that\'s handed out and possibly unable to get the specific information they\'re looking for.  

Supporting the mission of public history is incredibly important to the people who manage the sub: in fact, contributing to public history was not only the motivation that was most frequently described by mods, but it was also most often described as their primary motivation. In my interviews with them, mods described several reasons why AskHistorians’ role as a public history site is important. First, they see that AskHistorians provides justification for the study of history: 

&gt;The humanities does, as a whole, a very bad job of justifying its continued existence. . . We need to do a better job of that and I see AskHistorians as . . .a stepping stone towards a resolution of being public intellectuals, being public historians, justifying our reasons for our research. And I think the ability to bring in both enthusiasts and hobbyists, and professors, and master’s students into a history project, one of the larger history projects that’s on the Internet is my reason I guess, for doing that (Josh). 

There are a few keys points I’d like to highlight from Josh’s statement: first is that the sub’s popularity is demonstrative of a widespread interest in history– and not just any history, but good history. Although funding for the study of the humanities is decreasing and humanities departments at universities are downsizing, interest from a massive audience shows that history is important to people. Second, is that AskHistorians is egalitarian. While its rules and norms may mirror those established by academia, anyone who is interested can participate, even if it’s as a reader. 

Second, mods described how AskHistorians can help combat disinformation spread by bigoted groups:

&gt;I do see this enormous, really problematic, deeply dangerous, in my opinion, misunderstanding of history, often a misappropriation of history by political groups and people with often very nasty agendas. And I see AskHistorians as basically the best historical outreach program that basically anyone has come up with so far. And I’m more than proud to be a part of that, just for the mission it represents there. It’s teaching millions of people who might never have given a hoot about history all about it (u/Elm11).

That AskHistorians can do this is tied to its rules and norms and their enforcement. As one former mod put it, 

&gt;The AH mod team sees the deletion of such bad comments as ‘curating the sub’, akin to pulling out weeds so flowers can grow.

The weeds are off-topic discussion, anecdotes, jokes, abuse and harassment, and poorly sourced or misinformed responses. The flowers are comprehensive responses that get to the heart of questions asked. 

**A short history of ‘free speech’ on Reddit**

The rules that establish AskHistorians as a public history site are in direct contrast from the norms of the wider reddit-community. In AskHistorians, all rule-breaking content is removed. While it’s certainly not universal among all subs, there exists a general expectation on reddit that content promoted and hidden should be determined by users through voting, and otherwise, speech should be free from sanctioning. In this post, when I discuss free speech this is what I mean– I’m discussing reddit-style ‘free speech’ where speech should be free of consequences, not freedom of speech as guaranteed by the US Constitution. Reddit users’ expectation that speech on the site should be free from consequence exists for a reason. The idea of reddit as a bastion of free speech comes from above: the admin and their (lack of) policies. The following is a general timeline of speech related policy development.

* **2005**: Reddit is founded; there were no official limitations on what kind of content could be shared. 
* **May 2011**: The first site-wide rule is created when administrators [officially announced](https://redditblog.com/2011/05/24/reddit-we-need-to-talk/) that posting personally identifiable information would result in being banned from the site. The announcement came after [Gawker](https://gawker.com/5751581/misguided-internet-vigilantes-attack-college-students-cancer-fundraiser) published an article detailing an incidence of reddit-style vigilantism that targeted an alleged scammer. 
* **October 2011**: Media outlets, such as CNN and Gawker, publicized r/jailbait, a subreddit dedicated to posting sexually provocative pictures of young, often underage, women. After it was revealed that the subreddit had been used to exchange child pornography it was removed by administrators ([Morris, 2011](https://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-r-jailbait-shutdown-controversy/)). To my knowledge this is the first instance of a subreddit being removed by the admin. 
* **October 2012**: the creator of r/jailbait and a host of other pornographic subreddits, u/violentacrez, was doxxed on Gawker. 
* **October 2012**: In a leaked communiqué to moderators (and shared on [Gawker](https://gawker.com/5952349/reddit-ceo-speaks-out-on-violentacrez-in-leaked-memo-we-stand-for-free-speech?popular=true)), reddit’s then CEO, Yishan Wong defended free speech on reddit, saying: 

&gt;We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. 

Nonetheless, the trend of removing offensive subreddits continued. However, subreddits were not banned for their content; rather, they were banned for breaking other site-wide rules. 

* **June 2013**: r/n*****s was banned for brigading and vote manipulation ([Todd, 2013](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/does-anything-go-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-racist-corner-of-reddit/277585/)).
* **September 2014**: r/TheFappening, and spinoff subs were banned for copyright infringement. In [this blog post](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/), Yishan Wong again made a statement supporting ideals of free speech and placed responsibility for determining content seen on the user-base: 

&gt;We uphold the ideal of free speech on reddit as much as possible not because we are legally bound to, but because we believe that you – the user – has the right to choose between right and wrong, good and evil, and that it is your responsibility to do so. 

* **May 2015**: Reddit admins[ create an anti-harassment policy](https://redditblog.com/2015/05/14/promote-ideas-protect-people/). In the policy, users who are harassed are encouraged to contact reddit’s admin; however, the announcement does not outline what, if any, sanctioning harassers will face. 
* **June 2015**: r/fatpeoplehate (along with 4 smaller subs) [is banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/) for breaking the anti-harassment policy. The decision is unpopular– the announcement post was heavily downvoted, although gilded 33 times, and reddit users began circulating a petition calling for then CEO, Ellen Pao’s, resignation. They also began harassing and threatening her. 
* **July 2015**: Steve Huffman, CEO and cofounder, [makes a statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/) that seems to walk back on the ideal of free speech: 

&gt;Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen.

. . . despite a [seemly contradictory statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/35ym8t/promote_ideas_protect_people/cr91bpm/) made by cofounder, Alexis Ohanian in May that year: 

&gt;We made reddit so that as many people as possible could speak as freely as possible.

* **August 2015**: r/C***Town and several spinoff subreddits, were banned because they: 

&gt;exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else ([Steve Huffman, 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/)). 

This decision is largely supported by reddit users– the comment in which the ban was announced was highly upvoted and gilded 16 times. 

* **October 2017**: Site-wide [rules are updated](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), taking action against content that “encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people” or encourages the abuse of animals.  
* **November 2017**: r/incels [is banned](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/technology/incels-reddit-banned.html) as a result of the new policy.  

So, to recap, reddit has an evolving relationship with the ideal of free speech. Typically this relationship is reactionary as admins take action after receiving bad publicity, rather than when they become aware of the problem (this long-held belief was confirmed in [this interview](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/dan-mccomas-reddit-product-svp-and-imzy-founder-interview.html) with former admin, Dan McComas). While more recently administrators have relaxed their hardline stance on reddit as a bastion of free speech, actions ostensibly limiting some forms of speech (such as hate and violent speech) have not been rationalized by an appeal to morality (i.e., hate speech is wrong and we don’t want it on our site) but to appeals to law, personal privacy, and site growth. Whatever their reasons for removing subs may be, a recent study by [Chandrasekharan et al. \\(2017\\)](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw18-chand-hate.pdf) found that these actions had a generally positive effect on reddit, finding a site-wide decrease in types of hate speech associated with r/C***Town and r/fatpeoplehate after the subs were banned. 

Nonetheless, ‘free-speech’ remains the norm and prejudice and bigotry continue to be problematic for reddit and its users. This, in turn, affects AskHistorians. 

**Challenges of maintaining a public history site on reddit**

In [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/51ht85/a_huge_thank_you_to_the_askhistorians_mods/d7cosr2/), u/Elm11 describes the effect of reddit on AskHistorians: 

&gt; culture and popular perception of Reddit absolutely does have an impact on our activities. Reddit shapes the people who come through our door, the questions which are asked here, the issues which arise in threads on /r/all. 

His comment highlights the major themes I’m going to highlight in this post: how the differing norms and upvoting system affect new users’ enculturation into the community, and how reddit’s demographic (and its technology) shapes the scope of the sub. 

*Guaranteeing quality in the context of reddit-style ‘free speech’*

The key to ensuring that users get high quality responses to their questions is in the rules (posted in full in the [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules)). Anyone who’s interested in why AskHistorians has the rules they have should check out the wiki. It includes what each rule means, what forms of sanctioning will result should the rules be broken, and links to discussions explaining why each rule was developed. On the other hand, reddit has guidelines in the form of [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette); however, sanctioning for violating these guidelines is only indicated for three actions: posting personal information, off-reddit requests for votes, and spamming. These broad guidelines have the advantage of allowing considerable freedom to establish how subreddits are run. However, it also means that subreddits themselves are not required to have rules beyond the guidelines established by the site. In many cases, particularly subs with millions of subscribers (r/science being a notable exception), rules are generally pretty lax. The problem isn’t so much that reddit has loose guidelines and that many subs follow suit; the problem is that when loose guidelines are framed as ‘free speech,’ moderation is seen as censorship. For many reddit users, such as the one who made this removed comment, any and all censorship is bad– site destroying bad: 

&gt;11,000 upvotes. All the comments are deleted because of censorship. This post is a ghost town. Reddit is dead. R.I.P

The full log shared with me by the mods was a thread in which the vast majority of comments were removed. The conflation of moderation and censorship was a common theme in the removed comments, with several people expressing their belief that the mods had gone mad with power, even going so far as to compare them to dictators: 

&gt;Mods on this sub read too mucb about Hitler, huh?

The majority, however, ask where the comments are or complain about how many comments are removed, like this one:

&gt;wtf happened to all the comments here?

and this one:

&gt;Everything is banned on this subreddit? What is this cancer mod work? 

Occasionally, in meta discussions, users will express their dissatisfaction with the moderation style, such as one user in my recruitment post, who stated: 

&gt;I\'d just like to see all the answers and let community votes do the decision making, personally.

Most regular AskHistorians readers support the rules and their enforcement; in fact, [this census](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5fx1xc/census_500k_results/) showed that 91.6% believe the mods’ efforts are just about right. Nonetheless, users new to the sub and a minority of regular users are more supportive of reddit’s ‘hand-off’ approach to moderation. While letting the upvotes decide is congruent with reddit’s free-speech norm, interview participants described three reasons why this doesn’t work for AskHistorians, and those reasons are tied to the sub’s mission of public history. 

First, comments posted first are likely to receive the most upvotes (see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/64y44g/the_mostupvoted_comments_in_reddit_threads_arent/), by u/llewellynjean for more info). Because well sourced responses can take hours to write the highest quality responses are easily buried by lower quality but quick to write responses. This is frustrating for readers and experts alike. For example, when describing why he likes AskHistorians, Matt (a lurker) highlighted the importance of deleting low quality responses:

&gt;I don’t want to have to search through a bunch of people making Alexander the Great puns. I like going in and seeing one really good post from a flaired commentator . . . and then a whole bunch of crap deleted underneath – that’s beautiful! This is a wonderful part of the Internet!

As is reflected in his first sentence, good information can be difficult to find amid jokes and other comments that neglect to fully or reliably respond to the question. Highly upvoted yet poor quality answers are also frustrating for flaired users, such as u/MrDowntown: 

&gt;Something that I’ve encountered a couple of times in the last year to my frustration is that I won’t see a question for three or four hours and then somebody once had a college class that read a chapter about this topic will have given what I would consider a C- answer. Something that is only tangential to the central question that’s been asked, but by the time I get to the question they have been upvoted 30, 40 times, and my, what I think is a better answer [only] 8 or 10 people see it.

This leads to the second reason free-speech/let the upvotes decide doesn’t work for AskHistorians: most users are not experts in history and thus not qualified to assess the quality of a given response via upvoting. Not only is seeing poor answers more highly upvoted than your own answer frustrating to experts, allowing users to determine what they think is the best response by upvoting can promote and propagate harmful misinformation, an example of which is provided by u/commiespaceinvader: 

&gt;The frequently brought up argument that the ideas of Holocaust deniers will be easily defeated in the „free market place of ideas“ is to me as someone who deals with the subject an incredibly misguided one since: A.) lying is always easier than debunking lies. People who deny the Holocaust will simply say „crematoria don’t produce smoke! it is all a lie!“ and for those debunking them, it is necessary to actually make an argument based around how crematoria actually work, which is not something most of us have ever expected to deal with. And B.) it assumes that all people are rational and will follow the better argument (hello again, white, male, patriarchal notion of knowledge), which as current politics illustrate is decidedly not the case. People will believe what fits their world view. 

Another issue (also reflected in commiespaceinvader’s statement) is that not only may non-historians not be able to fully assess the quality of responses, but that voting often reflects users’ biases. This was also observed by [Mills \\(2018\\)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-017-0712-9), who, in his study on political advocacy on reddit, found that highly upvoted comments often reflect users’ consensus on a given topic. 

This leads to the third reason letting the upvotes decide is problematic: in a system where voting determines what content is seen and what is hidden, and where voting often reflects bias, this means that the biases held by the prevailing demographic are those that will be promoted. Reddit, and AskHistorians, is [predominantly young, white, and male](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5fx1xc/census_500k_results/). This affects not only what’s upvoted (and thus seen) but also what questions are asked. In other words, upvoted questions and answers often reflect interests and assumptions typically associated with young, white, men. 

The people I spoke to highlighted a number of ways the question asking and voting patterns of the demographic affected their participation. First, those whose expertise falls outside the interests of the prevailing demographic described rarely having the opportunity to answer questions in their field and when a question did touch on their area of expertise, it may not be from the perspective that most interested them, as was stated by u/mimicofmodes:

&gt;Most of my questions are about menswear (which I honestly don\'t care as much about as women\'s and children\'s dress), why don\'t we wear hats, why do we wear ties, etc. etc. While there are plenty of women who know nothing about fashion history, if there were more of them in the sub, they might at least ask about more interesting whys (when did we switch from stockings to tights, what\'s the history of pockets in women\'s dresses, did women of all classes wear corsets) - and maybe the rest of the fashion history community would be interested in asking each other questions here.

This pattern of interest is described by moderator, u/sunagainstgold: 

&gt;What is undeniably true, however, is the rarity of questions about women\'s issues (and swap in black, LGBTQ+, etc) and the patterns in which they tend to fall. Basically: rape, sex, marriage age, and rape. And rarely from women\'s perspective.

Similarly, when asked about the role of the demographic, moderator u/searocksandtrees responded: 

&gt;I think what it reflects to me is that there’s a lot more boyish topics that come up, whether it’s war and weapons and video games, and then a lot of really insensitive questions about rape.

This pattern of question asking (i.e., questions are rarely asked and when they are, it’s without sensitivity) also applies to questions about the history of the global south, as was described by a former mod:  

&gt;I hoped to use my position as mod to encourage people interested in African history, South Asian history, and other under-represented areas to get involved and apply for flair. However, there was never much success attracting people to apply for flair on those regions. I think that is because questions on those regions are rarely asked, and tend to receive fewer upvotes, so there is less opportunity for knowledgeable people to comment before the posts fall off the front page and are not seen by the sub\'s audience. In any case, my inability to promote those sorts of discussions and find more experts was disappointing. 

This quote highlights that this is not just a factor of demographics, but also of technology. If questions about the history of under-represented areas and people aren’t upvoted because they aren’t interesting to most users, they will get buried by questions that are. And one more sociotechnical factor that exacerbates the issue: most people ([64.5%](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5fx1xc/census_500k_results/)) enter AskHistorians through their front page (including me). This means that most people are only seeing questions asked that have a certain amount of upvotes, creating a feedback loop of hiding and promoting questions that appeal users in the majority demographic. 

In addition to the topics covered (or not) through question asking, the way questions are asked can also impact participation. In my last post I noted that some participants described learning how to detect bias from the way questions are asked. However, this bias can also, at times, discourage people from providing responses or continuing participation. That sentiment is reflected in this comment: 

&gt;East African here. Most of us are not on Reddit and enjoy discussions on a different forum. Reddit in general doesn\'t have a good reputation.

&gt;I lurk quite a bit and would probably be able to answer a few questions, but the way they are negatively worded is a turn off. I find myself expending too much energy dispelling negative stereotypes so I opt not to comment.

u/Commustar provides [a few examples](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5rfy0l/meta_why_is_there_a_dearth_of_indian_subcontinent/dd7ft22/) of what this looks like. Questions like, “Why was Africa less developed when Europeans started colonizing?” and “What was Nelson Mandela really like?” make certain assumptions: first about what is considered ‘developed’ and what is not, and second that history and the popular press present Nelson Mandela in a false light. Others ask about Africa through a European lens, such as “what did European explorers think of the African societies they encountered.” 

In circumstances in which biased or insensitive questions are asked, moderators are tasked with making the decision to let the question stand or delete it, and experts with the decision to respond to the question or ignore it. Moderator, u/Elm11 described deliberating whether or not to delete a highly upvoted, yet contentious question as the text accompanying the question contained a link to nude photographs of women: 

&gt;We had a discussion about removing it because the pictures are incredibly . . . exploitative . . . And we just felt so shitty as moderators, because here was our community, which is meant to be giving people answers about the past, but what it’s doing is providing redditors with porn. And that’s what it ended up doing. And that’s why people have ended up looking at it and it’s it become a platform for these poor women to become humiliated again, like 80 years after the event. Again.

Ultimately, they made the decision to let the question stand. 

Questions such as the examples shown above arise so often that the mods have an explanation for why this occurs. u/sunagainstgold outlines the phenomenon in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6qn4k3/monday_methods_we_talk_about_actual_human_beings/dkyp10f/):  

&gt;. . . it illustrates a distinct empathy gap, a socially-conditioned inability to default-extend intellectual personhood to people "different than us." One of the absolute most-asked questions on AH is "Did ancient soldiers have PTSD?" Sometimes we get to hear questions about knights having PTSD, too. Anyone want to take a swing at, in comparison, how many times people have asked about rape survivors and PTSD? (And when you search for it, be sure to filter out the questions that ask about the *soldier-rapists developing PTSD from massacring and raping civilians)* [italics in original]. 

Above I showed examples of this empathy gap in questions asked. It’s also reflected in responses given – responses that are often removed by mods and thus invisible to regular users. A few examples from the thread containing the pictures of nude women include jokes like this: 

&gt;Theyre going to get sandboxes. 

and this:

&gt;A standard new England clambake , as done in French Indochina during the war. 

as well as insults, such as this: 

&gt;. . . In addition, women (and many men) were known to have an increased level of pancakes (a.ka. “flapjacks) in their diet during the war . . . hence the nature of the “pancake-tits” seen in the photographs

This ties back into why letting the upvotes decide is not a model that works for AskHistorians. The women at whose expense jokes were made and bodies ridiculed were real, living people. Allowing comments like these to stand would fail to exhibit compassion.  

*Effects on AskHistorians participants* 

Because boundaries between subreddits are permeable, there’s only so much clearly defined and strictly applied rules can do. Mods have no control over users’ voting practices, the content of private messages, or comments made on other subreddits. While the work of the moderators creates a safe space within AskHistorians, women and other minorities are nonetheless aware of the potential consequences of being minority on reddit. Of the six women I spoke with, four described altering their participation (e.g., through identity management and self-censorship) due to negative encounters they personally experienced or witnessed on reddit. For example, one lurker described one of her reasons for not actively participating in AskHistorians:

&gt;popular subreddits can be pretty hostile sometimes. AskHistorians is EXTREMELY well-moderated, but I just don’t want to deal with the unnecessary stress that comes with submitting a post.

As another example, one moderator described her rationale for participating, ostensibly, as a man:

&gt;It’s mostly because you get enough shit thrown at you as an AskHistorians mod without it becoming gendered. I mean I have received death threats and people threatening to murder my family not knowing that I even had a family. And I can just imagine what kind of disgusting rape comments and sexual harassment comments I would be getting if I was actually openly female. Some of the mods are openly female and I don’t know how they do that. 

In an email exchange with one openly female mod, Ruth expressed that she did, indeed, receive gendered abuse once harassers realize she’s a woman:

&gt;Yes, I get the occasional nasty PM when it becomes apparent in a thread that I\'m female--I don\'t hide it; I want people to know there are women hanging around. 

In addition to altering participation on AskHistorians due to its location on reddit, participants also reported hiding their participation in AskHistorians from people they knew ‘in real life’ (or feeling embarrassed talking about it) because of reddit’s reputation. Despite participating in the largest online public history forum, professional, amateur, and student historians often did not feel comfortable sharing this with others. For example, when describing how he explained AskHistorians to a history professor at his university, u/Elm11 said: 

&gt;you’re treading so carefully because you can’t just say, ‘look, I run the world’s largest historical outreach project’ . . . But I’ve gotta say, ‘I run the world’s largest historical outreach project and it’s on a cesspool of a website.’ 

However, this was not the case for everyone. AskHistorians moderators and panelists have presented on their participation in AskHistorians at multiple national conferences. Other participants included participation on their CVs. As u/sunagainstgold explained in [her presentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/682ta1/friday_freeforall_april_28_2017/dgv7kc9/) at the National Council on Public History\'s Annual Conference
conference: 

&gt;The quality of work being produced on AskHistorians is often astronomical. We need to get over our own anonymous user accounts and claim it. 

**Strides forward and positive impacts**

Although AskHistorians’ location on reddit is, at times, problematic for the sub, there are also advantages. While highly upvoted posts often expose the sub to disruptive users en masse, upvoting also exposes these new users to AskHistorians. [This screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Iz5hn5F.png) shows the impact highly upvoted posts have on subscribership (those spikes correlate with posts that hit r/all). Mills (2018) describes how ranking posts by upvotes creates a positive feedback loop because other users mimic what they see upvoted. In AskHistorians, mods have created a new “Great Question” flair that I’m hopeful will circumvent this phenomenon by providing qualitative feedback of what a good question is, rather than relying on upvotes alone as indications of quality. Further, regular features, such as Monday Methods, and [meta] posts highlight pertinent issues that may not arise organically through question-asking, such as [this recent example](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/90p2m0/meta_askhistorians_now_featured_on_slatecom_where/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) on how ‘free speech’ enables Holocaust denial. Further, AskHistorians’ panel of experts, are, well, experts, in addressing misconceptions through their responses, such as [this example](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7fy1hh/why_were_womens_ah_undies_noticeably_more_pointy/dqfnnta/) in which u/chocolatepot explained why bras used to be pointy (spoiler alert: it’s not because women used to have pointy boobs!) 

While questions and upvotes might reflect the interests of the majority demographic, the community itself is incredibly receptive to learning new things and rewarding comments that demonstrate divergence from reddit’s norm. For example, [one commenter](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6790qv/meta_why_do_you_readparticipate_in_askhistorians/dgp1dvn/) in my recruitment post stated:  

&gt;Answers here have helped me inform my political opinion, my thoughts regarding issues such as LGBT rights and feminism (it was actually an answer here that made me fully consider patriarchy theory!), colonialism and and [sic] its very subtle effects on today\'s society, and last but perhaps most importantly, have had an influence on my overall thought process and problem solving. 

Comments banning users for using homophobic slurs have been gilded, and one participant told me about how a very feminist comment she’d written was not only highly upvoted, but also submitted to best of. 

AskHistorians’ success as a public history site may not only have a positive effect on individual users, but [as described](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/51ht85/a_huge_thank_you_to_the_askhistorians_mods/d7czfwm/) by u/restricteddata, on the rest of reddit and online communities more broadly: 

&gt;AH is sort of a "killer app" for "what the Internet could be if people are willing to put the effort into it" and I think that\'s very positive. The fact that the rest of Reddit can be so awful in so many different ways only underscores the contrast — if Reddit can be made to be non-awful, what else is possible in the world? 

Indeed, in a recent study AskHistorians was used as an example of a well moderated site in an attempt to identify abusive behaviour using machine learning techniques ([Chandrasekharan et al, 2017](http://eegilbert.org/papers/chi2017-chandrasekharan-boc.pdf)). AskHistorians’ rules are derived from norms established within academic history and modified to include a broader audience. Thus, the exact style or approach may not work for all other subreddits or communities. However, in carving out a regulated space in which readers can access trustworthy information about the past, and engage with it through question-asking, follow-up, and debate, AskHistorians is an apt model for promoting civil discourse online and at scale. This could not be maintained without the monumental efforts of the mod team. Their experiences are the subject of the next, and last, post.

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who may not have seen my &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a3p1ig/meta_i_wrote_my_phd_dissertation_on_askhistorians/"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, my name is Sarah Gilbert, and I wrote half of my dissertation on AskHistorians.

I&amp;#39;ve written three posts highlighting some of my findings and this is the second. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last post I briefly touched on challenges associated with sharing knowledge in AskHistorians. In this post I’m going to address what I see as a major source of those challenges (and others): the divergence of reddit&amp;#39;s norms from those of AskHistorians, and the technical features of reddit that enable, and even exacerbate, these challenges. As with the previous post, before I get into the details of the cultural and technical impacts of reddit on AskHistorians I’m going discuss aspects of my own experiences on reddit that impact this work.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positionality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a3p1ig/meta_i_wrote_my_phd_dissertation_on_askhistorians/"&gt;prior post&lt;/a&gt; provided a brief overview on the methodology I used in my dissertation work. Since this post is long and the data sources and analysis are the same, I’m not going to include that information again. However, my position relative to the work shared in this post is a bit different. To recap, &lt;a href="https://weingartenlrc.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/research-writing-whats-your-positionality/"&gt;positionality&lt;/a&gt; is a process undertaken by qualitative researchers so that they can be more aware of and attempt to mitigate biases that might come from demographic characteristics and lived experiences. I have both demographic characteristics and lived experiences that influence how I’ve framed this post, and even the fact that I chose to write it. As a woman user of a site that hosts misogynistic communities, I identified with the experiences of other women and felt a great deal of empathy towards participants who were affected by sexism, racism, and bigotry. While my identity as a woman likely led to some bias, I believe that, overall, my experiences as a reddit user played a positive role in conducting research in this space. Truth be told, metasubs are my guilty pleasure, and I find controversy that relates to reddit itself fascinating. I have a good idea of how reddit and its culture has developed over the years because I was there (since 2012 anyway), with metaphoric popcorn, as many of these developments unfolded. Much of this post was not written as an outsider looking in, but as a reddit user (and AskHistorians reader) myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is organized in three main parts: first I provide an overview of AskHistorians’ norms and describe how these norms establish the sub as a public history site. Next, I provide an historical overview of reddit’s norms, primarily as they pertain to speech. Finally, I describe how reddit’s norms and technology are both problematic and advantageous for AskHistorians as a public history site.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The development of AskHistorians as a public history site&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common joke made in meta posts (usually on AskHistorians’ birthday or in reference to the 20-year moratorium) goes something like this: “so in x years will someone write the history of AskHistorians?!” It’s a good joke– however, an early history of AskHistorians has already been written by &lt;a href="/u/agentdcf"&gt;u/agentdcf&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/682ta1/friday_freeforall_april_28_2017/dgv7zhf/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. It’s fascinating and I recommend everyone take a look. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for those who might want to avoid falling down an AskHistorians rabbit hole, the takeaways from his post that are most relevant here are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the first six months AskHistorians was, for all intents and purposes, lawless: flair was awarded based on an honor system; rules weren’t formalized, at least not in writing; answers often veered from the topic of the question; norms developed so that answers were long, detailed, and well sourced; and moderation was light, relying on users to enforce community norms through voting. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2012 the sub underwent a fast period of growth: those who appreciated the long, detailed, and well sourced answers began to share them on aggregation subs like DepthHub and BestOf, which drew traffic and subscribers (side note: this is how and when I found AskHistorians). Between March and May of that year, AskHistorians began its ‘Eternal September.’ &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid growth necessitated change: The influx of new users meant that not all of them enculturated existing norms on their own. This led to the development of rules to formalize these norms, and the establishment of a mod team to enforce them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while the strict set of rules we know to today weren’t established from the beginning, many (such as providing in-depth, well-sourced answers; avoiding jokes; and maintaining civility) existed informally though the norms of the community right from the beginning. It’s also these rules and norms that allow AskHistorians to function as a public history site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is public history? According to The National Council on Public History, public history is defined as “history beyond the walls of the traditional classroom” (n.d.). I’m in no position to go into more depth about what is, or isn’t public history, as that’s not my area of expertise. However, in our interview &lt;a href="/u/mimicofmodes"&gt;u/mimicofmodes&lt;/a&gt; described why AskHistorians stands out as a public history site: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . it&amp;#39;s the most direct method of public history out there. At a living history site you have site interpreters . . . between the public and the curators/researchers; a book is a one-way street, as is a museum exhibition, whether the recipient is passively taking the information that&amp;#39;s handed out and possibly unable to get the specific information they&amp;#39;re looking for.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting the mission of public history is incredibly important to the people who manage the sub: in fact, contributing to public history was not only the motivation that was most frequently described by mods, but it was also most often described as their primary motivation. In my interviews with them, mods described several reasons why AskHistorians’ role as a public history site is important. First, they see that AskHistorians provides justification for the study of history: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The humanities does, as a whole, a very bad job of justifying its continued existence. . . We need to do a better job of that and I see AskHistorians as . . .a stepping stone towards a resolution of being public intellectuals, being public historians, justifying our reasons for our research. And I think the ability to bring in both enthusiasts and hobbyists, and professors, and master’s students into a history project, one of the larger history projects that’s on the Internet is my reason I guess, for doing that (Josh). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few keys points I’d like to highlight from Josh’s statement: first is that the sub’s popularity is demonstrative of a widespread interest in history– and not just any history, but good history. Although funding for the study of the humanities is decreasing and humanities departments at universities are downsizing, interest from a massive audience shows that history is important to people. Second, is that AskHistorians is egalitarian. While its rules and norms may mirror those established by academia, anyone who is interested can participate, even if it’s as a reader. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, mods described how AskHistorians can help combat disinformation spread by bigoted groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do see this enormous, really problematic, deeply dangerous, in my opinion, misunderstanding of history, often a misappropriation of history by political groups and people with often very nasty agendas. And I see AskHistorians as basically the best historical outreach program that basically anyone has come up with so far. And I’m more than proud to be a part of that, just for the mission it represents there. It’s teaching millions of people who might never have given a hoot about history all about it (&lt;a href="/u/Elm11"&gt;u/Elm11&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That AskHistorians can do this is tied to its rules and norms and their enforcement. As one former mod put it, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AH mod team sees the deletion of such bad comments as ‘curating the sub’, akin to pulling out weeds so flowers can grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weeds are off-topic discussion, anecdotes, jokes, abuse and harassment, and poorly sourced or misinformed responses. The flowers are comprehensive responses that get to the heart of questions asked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A short history of ‘free speech’ on Reddit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules that establish AskHistorians as a public history site are in direct contrast from the norms of the wider reddit-community. In AskHistorians, all rule-breaking content is removed. While it’s certainly not universal among all subs, there exists a general expectation on reddit that content promoted and hidden should be determined by users through voting, and otherwise, speech should be free from sanctioning. In this post, when I discuss free speech this is what I mean– I’m discussing reddit-style ‘free speech’ where speech should be free of consequences, not freedom of speech as guaranteed by the US Constitution. Reddit users’ expectation that speech on the site should be free from consequence exists for a reason. The idea of reddit as a bastion of free speech comes from above: the admin and their (lack of) policies. The following is a general timeline of speech related policy development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2005&lt;/strong&gt;: Reddit is founded; there were no official limitations on what kind of content could be shared. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2011&lt;/strong&gt;: The first site-wide rule is created when administrators &lt;a href="https://redditblog.com/2011/05/24/reddit-we-need-to-talk/"&gt;officially announced&lt;/a&gt; that posting personally identifiable information would result in being banned from the site. The announcement came after &lt;a href="https://gawker.com/5751581/misguided-internet-vigilantes-attack-college-students-cancer-fundraiser"&gt;Gawker&lt;/a&gt; published an article detailing an incidence of reddit-style vigilantism that targeted an alleged scammer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2011&lt;/strong&gt;: Media outlets, such as CNN and Gawker, publicized &lt;a href="/r/jailbait"&gt;r/jailbait&lt;/a&gt;, a subreddit dedicated to posting sexually provocative pictures of young, often underage, women. After it was revealed that the subreddit had been used to exchange child pornography it was removed by administrators (&lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-r-jailbait-shutdown-controversy/"&gt;Morris, 2011&lt;/a&gt;). To my knowledge this is the first instance of a subreddit being removed by the admin. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2012&lt;/strong&gt;: the creator of &lt;a href="/r/jailbait"&gt;r/jailbait&lt;/a&gt; and a host of other pornographic subreddits, &lt;a href="/u/violentacrez"&gt;u/violentacrez&lt;/a&gt;, was doxxed on Gawker. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2012&lt;/strong&gt;: In a leaked communiqué to moderators (and shared on &lt;a href="https://gawker.com/5952349/reddit-ceo-speaks-out-on-violentacrez-in-leaked-memo-we-stand-for-free-speech?popular=true"&gt;Gawker&lt;/a&gt;), reddit’s then CEO, Yishan Wong defended free speech on reddit, saying: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the trend of removing offensive subreddits continued. However, subreddits were not banned for their content; rather, they were banned for breaking other site-wide rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2013&lt;/strong&gt;: r/n*****s was banned for brigading and vote manipulation (&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/does-anything-go-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-racist-corner-of-reddit/277585/"&gt;Todd, 2013&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 2014&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="/r/TheFappening"&gt;r/TheFappening&lt;/a&gt;, and spinoff subs were banned for copyright infringement. In &lt;a href="https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Yishan Wong again made a statement supporting ideals of free speech and placed responsibility for determining content seen on the user-base: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We uphold the ideal of free speech on reddit as much as possible not because we are legally bound to, but because we believe that you – the user – has the right to choose between right and wrong, good and evil, and that it is your responsibility to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2015&lt;/strong&gt;: Reddit admins&lt;a href="https://redditblog.com/2015/05/14/promote-ideas-protect-people/"&gt; create an anti-harassment policy&lt;/a&gt;. In the policy, users who are harassed are encouraged to contact reddit’s admin; however, the announcement does not outline what, if any, sanctioning harassers will face. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2015&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="/r/fatpeoplehate"&gt;r/fatpeoplehate&lt;/a&gt; (along with 4 smaller subs) &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/"&gt;is banned&lt;/a&gt; for breaking the anti-harassment policy. The decision is unpopular– the announcement post was heavily downvoted, although gilded 33 times, and reddit users began circulating a petition calling for then CEO, Ellen Pao’s, resignation. They also began harassing and threatening her. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2015&lt;/strong&gt;: Steve Huffman, CEO and cofounder, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/"&gt;makes a statement&lt;/a&gt; that seems to walk back on the ideal of free speech: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. . . despite a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/35ym8t/promote_ideas_protect_people/cr91bpm/"&gt;seemly contradictory statement&lt;/a&gt; made by cofounder, Alexis Ohanian in May that year: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made reddit so that as many people as possible could speak as freely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 2015&lt;/strong&gt;: r/C***Town and several spinoff subreddits, were banned because they: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/"&gt;Steve Huffman, 2015&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision is largely supported by reddit users– the comment in which the ban was announced was highly upvoted and gilded 16 times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2017&lt;/strong&gt;: Site-wide &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/"&gt;rules are updated&lt;/a&gt;, taking action against content that “encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people” or encourages the abuse of animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2017&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="/r/incels"&gt;r/incels&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/technology/incels-reddit-banned.html"&gt;is banned&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the new policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to recap, reddit has an evolving relationship with the ideal of free speech. Typically this relationship is reactionary as admins take action after receiving bad publicity, rather than when they become aware of the problem (this long-held belief was confirmed in &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/dan-mccomas-reddit-product-svp-and-imzy-founder-interview.html"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; with former admin, Dan McComas). While more recently administrators have relaxed their hardline stance on reddit as a bastion of free speech, actions ostensibly limiting some forms of speech (such as hate and violent speech) have not been rationalized by an appeal to morality (i.e., hate speech is wrong and we don’t want it on our site) but to appeals to law, personal privacy, and site growth. Whatever their reasons for removing subs may be, a recent study by &lt;a href="http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw18-chand-hate.pdf"&gt;Chandrasekharan et al. (2017)&lt;/a&gt; found that these actions had a generally positive effect on reddit, finding a site-wide decrease in types of hate speech associated with r/C***Town and &lt;a href="/r/fatpeoplehate"&gt;r/fatpeoplehate&lt;/a&gt; after the subs were banned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, ‘free-speech’ remains the norm and prejudice and bigotry continue to be problematic for reddit and its users. This, in turn, affects AskHistorians. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges of maintaining a public history site on reddit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/51ht85/a_huge_thank_you_to_the_askhistorians_mods/d7cosr2/"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/u/Elm11"&gt;u/Elm11&lt;/a&gt; describes the effect of reddit on AskHistorians: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;culture and popular perception of Reddit absolutely does have an impact on our activities. Reddit shapes the people who come through our door, the questions which are asked here, the issues which arise in threads on &lt;a href="/r/all"&gt;/r/all&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His comment highlights the major themes I’m going to highlight in this post: how the differing norms and upvoting system affect new users’ enculturation into the community, and how reddit’s demographic (and its technology) shapes the scope of the sub. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guaranteeing quality in the context of reddit-style ‘free speech’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to ensuring that users get high quality responses to their questions is in the rules (posted in full in the &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;). Anyone who’s interested in why AskHistorians has the rules they have should check out the wiki. It includes what each rule means, what forms of sanctioning will result should the rules be broken, and links to discussions explaining why each rule was developed. On the other hand, reddit has guidelines in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette"&gt;reddiquette&lt;/a&gt;; however, sanctioning for violating these guidelines is only indicated for three actions: posting personal information, off-reddit requests for votes, and spamming. These broad guidelines have the advantage of allowing considerable freedom to establish how subreddits are run. However, it also means that subreddits themselves are not required to have rules beyond the guidelines established by the site. In many cases, particularly subs with millions of subscribers (&lt;a href="/r/science"&gt;r/science&lt;/a&gt; being a notable exception), rules are generally pretty lax. The problem isn’t so much that reddit has loose guidelines and that many subs follow suit; the problem is that when loose guidelines are framed as ‘free speech,’ moderation is seen as censorship. For many reddit users, such as the one who made this removed comment, any and all censorship is bad– site destroying bad: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11,000 upvotes. All the comments are deleted because of censorship. This post is a ghost town. Reddit is dead. R.I.P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full log shared with me by the mods was a thread in which the vast majority of comments were removed. The conflation of moderation and censorship was a common theme in the removed comments, with several people expressing their belief that the mods had gone mad with power, even going so far as to compare them to dictators: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mods on this sub read too mucb about Hitler, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority, however, ask where the comments are or complain about how many comments are removed, like this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wtf happened to all the comments here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is banned on this subreddit? What is this cancer mod work? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, in meta discussions, users will express their dissatisfaction with the moderation style, such as one user in my recruitment post, who stated: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d just like to see all the answers and let community votes do the decision making, personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most regular AskHistorians readers support the rules and their enforcement; in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5fx1xc/census_500k_results/"&gt;this census&lt;/a&gt; showed that 91.6% believe the mods’ efforts are just about right. Nonetheless, users new to the sub and a minority of regular users are more supportive of reddit’s ‘hand-off’ approach to moderation. While letting the upvotes decide is congruent with reddit’s free-speech norm, interview participants described three reasons why this doesn’t work for AskHistorians, and those reasons are tied to the sub’s mission of public history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, comments posted first are likely to receive the most upvotes (see &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/64y44g/the_mostupvoted_comments_in_reddit_threads_arent/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href="/u/llewellynjean"&gt;u/llewellynjean&lt;/a&gt; for more info). Because well sourced responses can take hours to write the highest quality responses are easily buried by lower quality but quick to write responses. This is frustrating for readers and experts alike. For example, when describing why he likes AskHistorians, Matt (a lurker) highlighted the importance of deleting low quality responses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to have to search through a bunch of people making Alexander the Great puns. I like going in and seeing one really good post from a flaired commentator . . . and then a whole bunch of crap deleted underneath – that’s beautiful! This is a wonderful part of the Internet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is reflected in his first sentence, good information can be difficult to find amid jokes and other comments that neglect to fully or reliably respond to the question. Highly upvoted yet poor quality answers are also frustrating for flaired users, such as &lt;a href="/u/MrDowntown"&gt;u/MrDowntown&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I’ve encountered a couple of times in the last year to my frustration is that I won’t see a question for three or four hours and then somebody once had a college class that read a chapter about this topic will have given what I would consider a C- answer. Something that is only tangential to the central question that’s been asked, but by the time I get to the question they have been upvoted 30, 40 times, and my, what I think is a better answer [only] 8 or 10 people see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to the second reason free-speech/let the upvotes decide doesn’t work for AskHistorians: most users are not experts in history and thus not qualified to assess the quality of a given response via upvoting. Not only is seeing poor answers more highly upvoted than your own answer frustrating to experts, allowing users to determine what they think is the best response by upvoting can promote and propagate harmful misinformation, an example of which is provided by &lt;a href="/u/commiespaceinvader"&gt;u/commiespaceinvader&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frequently brought up argument that the ideas of Holocaust deniers will be easily defeated in the „free market place of ideas“ is to me as someone who deals with the subject an incredibly misguided one since: A.) lying is always easier than debunking lies. People who deny the Holocaust will simply say „crematoria don’t produce smoke! it is all a lie!“ and for those debunking them, it is necessary to actually make an argument based around how crematoria actually work, which is not something most of us have ever expected to deal with. And B.) it assumes that all people are rational and will follow the better argument (hello again, white, male, patriarchal notion of knowledge), which as current politics illustrate is decidedly not the case. People will believe what fits their world view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue (also reflected in commiespaceinvader’s statement) is that not only may non-historians not be able to fully assess the quality of responses, but that voting often reflects users’ biases. This was also observed by &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-017-0712-9"&gt;Mills (2018)&lt;/a&gt;, who, in his study on political advocacy on reddit, found that highly upvoted comments often reflect users’ consensus on a given topic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to the third reason letting the upvotes decide is problematic: in a system where voting determines what content is seen and what is hidden, and where voting often reflects bias, this means that the biases held by the prevailing demographic are those that will be promoted. Reddit, and AskHistorians, is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5fx1xc/census_500k_results/"&gt;predominantly young, white, and male&lt;/a&gt;. This affects not only what’s upvoted (and thus seen) but also what questions are asked. In other words, upvoted questions and answers often reflect interests and assumptions typically associated with young, white, men. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people I spoke to highlighted a number of ways the question asking and voting patterns of the demographic affected their participation. First, those whose expertise falls outside the interests of the prevailing demographic described rarely having the opportunity to answer questions in their field and when a question did touch on their area of expertise, it may not be from the perspective that most interested them, as was stated by &lt;a href="/u/mimicofmodes"&gt;u/mimicofmodes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my questions are about menswear (which I honestly don&amp;#39;t care as much about as women&amp;#39;s and children&amp;#39;s dress), why don&amp;#39;t we wear hats, why do we wear ties, etc. etc. While there are plenty of women who know nothing about fashion history, if there were more of them in the sub, they might at least ask about more interesting whys (when did we switch from stockings to tights, what&amp;#39;s the history of pockets in women&amp;#39;s dresses, did women of all classes wear corsets) - and maybe the rest of the fashion history community would be interested in asking each other questions here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern of interest is described by moderator, &lt;a href="/u/sunagainstgold"&gt;u/sunagainstgold&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is undeniably true, however, is the rarity of questions about women&amp;#39;s issues (and swap in black, LGBTQ+, etc) and the patterns in which they tend to fall. Basically: rape, sex, marriage age, and rape. And rarely from women&amp;#39;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when asked about the role of the demographic, moderator &lt;a href="/u/searocksandtrees"&gt;u/searocksandtrees&lt;/a&gt; responded: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what it reflects to me is that there’s a lot more boyish topics that come up, whether it’s war and weapons and video games, and then a lot of really insensitive questions about rape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern of question asking (i.e., questions are rarely asked and when they are, it’s without sensitivity) also applies to questions about the history of the global south, as was described by a former mod:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hoped to use my position as mod to encourage people interested in African history, South Asian history, and other under-represented areas to get involved and apply for flair. However, there was never much success attracting people to apply for flair on those regions. I think that is because questions on those regions are rarely asked, and tend to receive fewer upvotes, so there is less opportunity for knowledgeable people to comment before the posts fall off the front page and are not seen by the sub&amp;#39;s audience. In any case, my inability to promote those sorts of discussions and find more experts was disappointing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote highlights that this is not just a factor of demographics, but also of technology. If questions about the history of under-represented areas and people aren’t upvoted because they aren’t interesting to most users, they will get buried by questions that are. And one more sociotechnical factor that exacerbates the issue: most people (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5fx1xc/census_500k_results/"&gt;64.5%&lt;/a&gt;) enter AskHistorians through their front page (including me). This means that most people are only seeing questions asked that have a certain amount of upvotes, creating a feedback loop of hiding and promoting questions that appeal users in the majority demographic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the topics covered (or not) through question asking, the way questions are asked can also impact participation. In my last post I noted that some participants described learning how to detect bias from the way questions are asked. However, this bias can also, at times, discourage people from providing responses or continuing participation. That sentiment is reflected in this comment: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East African here. Most of us are not on Reddit and enjoy discussions on a different forum. Reddit in general doesn&amp;#39;t have a good reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lurk quite a bit and would probably be able to answer a few questions, but the way they are negatively worded is a turn off. I find myself expending too much energy dispelling negative stereotypes so I opt not to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/u/Commustar"&gt;u/Commustar&lt;/a&gt; provides &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5rfy0l/meta_why_is_there_a_dearth_of_indian_subcontinent/dd7ft22/"&gt;a few examples&lt;/a&gt; of what this looks like. Questions like, “Why was Africa less developed when Europeans started colonizing?” and “What was Nelson Mandela really like?” make certain assumptions: first about what is considered ‘developed’ and what is not, and second that history and the popular press present Nelson Mandela in a false light. Others ask about Africa through a European lens, such as “what did European explorers think of the African societies they encountered.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In circumstances in which biased or insensitive questions are asked, moderators are tasked with making the decision to let the question stand or delete it, and experts with the decision to respond to the question or ignore it. Moderator, &lt;a href="/u/Elm11"&gt;u/Elm11&lt;/a&gt; described deliberating whether or not to delete a highly upvoted, yet contentious question as the text accompanying the question contained a link to nude photographs of women: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a discussion about removing it because the pictures are incredibly . . . exploitative . . . And we just felt so shitty as moderators, because here was our community, which is meant to be giving people answers about the past, but what it’s doing is providing redditors with porn. And that’s what it ended up doing. And that’s why people have ended up looking at it and it’s it become a platform for these poor women to become humiliated again, like 80 years after the event. Again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, they made the decision to let the question stand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions such as the examples shown above arise so often that the mods have an explanation for why this occurs. &lt;a href="/u/sunagainstgold"&gt;u/sunagainstgold&lt;/a&gt; outlines the phenomenon in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6qn4k3/monday_methods_we_talk_about_actual_human_beings/dkyp10f/"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . it illustrates a distinct empathy gap, a socially-conditioned inability to default-extend intellectual personhood to people &amp;quot;different than us.&amp;quot; One of the absolute most-asked questions on AH is &amp;quot;Did ancient soldiers have PTSD?&amp;quot; Sometimes we get to hear questions about knights having PTSD, too. Anyone want to take a swing at, in comparison, how many times people have asked about rape survivors and PTSD? (And when you search for it, be sure to filter out the questions that ask about the &lt;em&gt;soldier-rapists developing PTSD from massacring and raping civilians)&lt;/em&gt; [italics in original]. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above I showed examples of this empathy gap in questions asked. It’s also reflected in responses given – responses that are often removed by mods and thus invisible to regular users. A few examples from the thread containing the pictures of nude women include jokes like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theyre going to get sandboxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A standard new England clambake , as done in French Indochina during the war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as well as insults, such as this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . In addition, women (and many men) were known to have an increased level of pancakes (a.ka. “flapjacks) in their diet during the war . . . hence the nature of the “pancake-tits” seen in the photographs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ties back into why letting the upvotes decide is not a model that works for AskHistorians. The women at whose expense jokes were made and bodies ridiculed were real, living people. Allowing comments like these to stand would fail to exhibit compassion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Effects on AskHistorians participants&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because boundaries between subreddits are permeable, there’s only so much clearly defined and strictly applied rules can do. Mods have no control over users’ voting practices, the content of private messages, or comments made on other subreddits. While the work of the moderators creates a safe space within AskHistorians, women and other minorities are nonetheless aware of the potential consequences of being minority on reddit. Of the six women I spoke with, four described altering their participation (e.g., through identity management and self-censorship) due to negative encounters they personally experienced or witnessed on reddit. For example, one lurker described one of her reasons for not actively participating in AskHistorians:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;popular subreddits can be pretty hostile sometimes. AskHistorians is EXTREMELY well-moderated, but I just don’t want to deal with the unnecessary stress that comes with submitting a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As another example, one moderator described her rationale for participating, ostensibly, as a man:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s mostly because you get enough shit thrown at you as an AskHistorians mod without it becoming gendered. I mean I have received death threats and people threatening to murder my family not knowing that I even had a family. And I can just imagine what kind of disgusting rape comments and sexual harassment comments I would be getting if I was actually openly female. Some of the mods are openly female and I don’t know how they do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an email exchange with one openly female mod, Ruth expressed that she did, indeed, receive gendered abuse once harassers realize she’s a woman:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I get the occasional nasty PM when it becomes apparent in a thread that I&amp;#39;m female--I don&amp;#39;t hide it; I want people to know there are women hanging around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to altering participation on AskHistorians due to its location on reddit, participants also reported hiding their participation in AskHistorians from people they knew ‘in real life’ (or feeling embarrassed talking about it) because of reddit’s reputation. Despite participating in the largest online public history forum, professional, amateur, and student historians often did not feel comfortable sharing this with others. For example, when describing how he explained AskHistorians to a history professor at his university, &lt;a href="/u/Elm11"&gt;u/Elm11&lt;/a&gt; said: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you’re treading so carefully because you can’t just say, ‘look, I run the world’s largest historical outreach project’ . . . But I’ve gotta say, ‘I run the world’s largest historical outreach project and it’s on a cesspool of a website.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this was not the case for everyone. AskHistorians moderators and panelists have presented on their participation in AskHistorians at multiple national conferences. Other participants included participation on their CVs. As &lt;a href="/u/sunagainstgold"&gt;u/sunagainstgold&lt;/a&gt; explained in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/682ta1/friday_freeforall_april_28_2017/dgv7kc9/"&gt;her presentation&lt;/a&gt; at the National Council on Public History&amp;#39;s Annual Conference
conference: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of work being produced on AskHistorians is often astronomical. We need to get over our own anonymous user accounts and claim it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strides forward and positive impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although AskHistorians’ location on reddit is, at times, problematic for the sub, there are also advantages. While highly upvoted posts often expose the sub to disruptive users en masse, upvoting also exposes these new users to AskHistorians. &lt;a href="https://i.imgur.com/Iz5hn5F.png"&gt;This screenshot&lt;/a&gt; shows the impact highly upvoted posts have on subscribership (those spikes correlate with posts that hit &lt;a href="/r/all"&gt;r/all&lt;/a&gt;). Mills (2018) describes how ranking posts by upvotes creates a positive feedback loop because other users mimic what they see upvoted. In AskHistorians, mods have created a new “Great Question” flair that I’m hopeful will circumvent this phenomenon by providing qualitative feedback of what a good question is, rather than relying on upvotes alone as indications of quality. Further, regular features, such as Monday Methods, and [meta] posts highlight pertinent issues that may not arise organically through question-asking, such as &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/90p2m0/meta_askhistorians_now_featured_on_slatecom_where/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=user&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=frontpage"&gt;this recent example&lt;/a&gt; on how ‘free speech’ enables Holocaust denial. Further, AskHistorians’ panel of experts, are, well, experts, in addressing misconceptions through their responses, such as &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7fy1hh/why_were_womens_ah_undies_noticeably_more_pointy/dqfnnta/"&gt;this example&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href="/u/chocolatepot"&gt;u/chocolatepot&lt;/a&gt; explained why bras used to be pointy (spoiler alert: it’s not because women used to have pointy boobs!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While questions and upvotes might reflect the interests of the majority demographic, the community itself is incredibly receptive to learning new things and rewarding comments that demonstrate divergence from reddit’s norm. For example, &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6790qv/meta_why_do_you_readparticipate_in_askhistorians/dgp1dvn/"&gt;one commenter&lt;/a&gt; in my recruitment post stated:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answers here have helped me inform my political opinion, my thoughts regarding issues such as LGBT rights and feminism (it was actually an answer here that made me fully consider patriarchy theory!), colonialism and and [sic] its very subtle effects on today&amp;#39;s society, and last but perhaps most importantly, have had an influence on my overall thought process and problem solving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments banning users for using homophobic slurs have been gilded, and one participant told me about how a very feminist comment she’d written was not only highly upvoted, but also submitted to best of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AskHistorians’ success as a public history site may not only have a positive effect on individual users, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/51ht85/a_huge_thank_you_to_the_askhistorians_mods/d7czfwm/"&gt;as described&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="/u/restricteddata"&gt;u/restricteddata&lt;/a&gt;, on the rest of reddit and online communities more broadly: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AH is sort of a &amp;quot;killer app&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;what the Internet could be if people are willing to put the effort into it&amp;quot; and I think that&amp;#39;s very positive. The fact that the rest of Reddit can be so awful in so many different ways only underscores the contrast — if Reddit can be made to be non-awful, what else is possible in the world? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in a recent study AskHistorians was used as an example of a well moderated site in an attempt to identify abusive behaviour using machine learning techniques (&lt;a href="http://eegilbert.org/papers/chi2017-chandrasekharan-boc.pdf"&gt;Chandrasekharan et al, 2017&lt;/a&gt;). AskHistorians’ rules are derived from norms established within academic history and modified to include a broader audience. Thus, the exact style or approach may not work for all other subreddits or communities. However, in carving out a regulated space in which readers can access trustworthy information about the past, and engage with it through question-asking, follow-up, and debate, AskHistorians is an apt model for promoting civil discourse online and at scale. This could not be maintained without the monumental efforts of the mod team. Their experiences are the subject of the next, and last, post.  &lt;/p&gt;

History is normally about events so it is normally about the latter. But I want to know more about the context of the events rather than the events themselves. I often feel that my lack of understanding of the context of the events prevents me from understanding the events.

For example if some history text is telling me about the event of how a king increased some taxes. This means very little unless I know a fair bit about what the nature of kingship is at that time and place. Or what the taxation system was like and how it worked in detail.

I am thinking of something like a book which describes what the situation (political, social, economic) was at some particular place at some particular time. It would just describe what it was like then. Without assuming any knowledge on the part of the modern reader. Almost as if it was a travelogue but about a place distant in time as well as space.

A more particular example. There is a lot written about 19th century Europe and this is about which nation (France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Britain) is going to "dominate" Europe. That word (or a similar one) is used a lot when describing the events. The history is a description of the events that happen with these nations doing things in their attempts to become the "dominant power". But I don\'t really understand what constitutes exactly being "dominant" in this sense. Or why the nations want this. So the description of the events then seem rather meaningless.

Another particular example. I want to read about the Reformation. But I need to understand what the situation was before the Reformation. Books about the Reformation tend to give the bare minimum information about the pre-existing situation. But I feel like I need to know more about that.

Another example. Often when reading the history of a war it seems as if I am just reading descriptions of masses of men moving in certain ways and killing each other in certain ways. It\'s as if you could remove the dates and names of places and it could be about anywhere. 

The closest to what I want that I have seen so far are some of the books by Fernand Braudel. But they are still rather too wide in scope. How about a book which was focussed on just one specific year.

I think my ideal history book would be mostly static. A 500 page book on the French Revolution would be 496 pages of description of the structure and internal workings of the economy, society and life in France as it was in the early 1780s. And then four pages of what happened 1789. (OK I\'m exaggerating here!)

I hope my question makes sense. I appreciate that it might sound stupid or completely and utterly missing the point. (Sometimes that\'s how it sounds to me.) If it does then please say so.

I don\'t know if there\'s a term for the sort of history writing I\'m asking about. Something like "descriptive history". Or maybe "static history".

Hitler turned out to be the end of Weimar, and Communist leaders were frequently imprisoned and killed by the Nazis. But let\'s not look at this in historical hindsight.

I forget where I first heard about this, and Wikiquote notes that the original quote "Nach Hitler kommen Wir" may or may not have actually been said by Ernst Thälmann, then leader of the KDP, the German Communist Party. This does appear to have been a slogan of the early 30\'s in Germany, and sees to be particularly associated with the "[social fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_fascism)" outlook, the idea that the other major left party, the Social Democrat Part (SDP) was in some ways "just as bad" as the fascists and they would only continue the capitalist system.

Obviously, one of the reasons this period is often forgotten is because Communist policy quickly shifted in the subsequent period. While the early 1930\'s was all about calling social democrats "social fascists", after 1934-5 Communist parties across the world were encouraged to form (temporary) alliances with them as "[popular fronts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_front)". This popular front period apparently came to an end almost as quickly as it began, with Molotov–Ribbentrop pact between Nazi Germany and USSR, when Moscow (and so all the parties it supported/controlled through Comintern) started heading for an official policy of "peace" rather than "united anti-fascism". Obviously, all these were too late for the German Communists, who were crushed quickly once Hitler rose to power.

But what about this period, from roughly 1930 until 1933/4, when the Nazis gained control of all the levers of German government? 

So, in short, **in 1931, the German Communist party declared "After Hitler, Our Turn". Did they actually believe this? Did other believe this? What were they going to do on their "turn"? Would Communists coming to power have meant the end of Weimar?** Obviously, the period of intense instability in the early 30\'s encouraged extreme polarization, benefiting both the Nazis and the Communists, but did the Communists believe that they\'d actually get their chance to rule alone after Hitler (whose chaotic rule would "obviously" show the contradictions of capitalism more clearly)?

The sentence also mentions 3 other men who were given only reprimand because they were "present, but not danced".

I am intrigued in what was the legal background for the sentence? Was it actually illegal to break the Lent, or fraternizing with Jewish peoples, or both, or only together? Was the lent observance so strict you could go to jail for breaking it? Was associating with the Jews so looked down on that it was actually illegal?

Were behaviors like these two (or five) men exhibited, breaking of the Lent rules and partying, a frequent occurrence?

Some context for the question.  This verdict comes from the background of Martin Behaim, probably 24-years old at a time, who later traveled and spent time in Portugal where he was possibly involved in geographical and astronomical research for king Joao II. He became famous for creating map and a [globe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdapfel) of the world for Nuremberg city council in 1490-1492.



Translation, as given, of the full verdict:

&gt;[Sentence, Saturday, Mach 1, 1483]

&gt;Item. Martin Beheim and Sebalt Deichsler are each condemned to 8 days imprisonment, partly as an act of grace, such punishment to be undergone in their person, because on Ember day last they danced with the Jews, at a wedding. Reprieved until Judica next [March 16].

&gt;But Hans Imhof, H. Frey and a maker of compasses, having been present but not having danced, are to be reprimanded. Saturday before Sunday Oculi [March 1, 1483]. (Ibidem, 1483, H. 2, f. 10\'.)

&gt;Martin Beheim\'s reprieve is extended until fourteen days after his return from Frankfurt.

The verdict is taken from [*Martin Behaim, his life and his globe*](http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm/ref/collection/eng_tech/id/5434), by E. G. Ravenstein from 1908, [page 110](http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm/printview/collection/eng_tech/id/5434/type/compoundobject/show/5405) with a original transcript in old German and a translation.',

I just watched a interview by [Joe Rogan with Robert Schoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vka2ZgzZTvo). Some of what he said made me suspicious of his legitimacy as a historian, but as a non-historian, I am not confident enough to come to a conclusion.

On one hand, he is a tenured professor at an accredited institution, he is published, he has been to the sites he speaks about, and the evidence he presents in the interview seems to make sense. On the other hand, there are quite a few peer criticisms I found online and he has a bit of a victim complex when it comes to going against the status quo.

I have a physics degree so this last one makes me suspicious in my own field of research, but I don\'t know if I can carry that suspicion over to other disciplines like history and geology.',

I have always been secretly curious about what sex was like in the Middle Ages, specifically oral sex.  As a woman (22F) I get self-conscious about receiving oral sex if I haven\'t showered in a few hours, let alone days or weeks.  I can only imagine how unbearable it would have been to perform cunnilingus back before women were regularly bathing. Therefore, I was surprised to read that back in the Middle Ages, it was widely believed that in order to conceive a baby, *both* parties must reach orgasm.  











&gt; Contrary to what you may be getting from medieval romance novels, the medieval scientific theory of sexual reproduction had a pretty strong role for the lady\'s orgasm. Namely, they thought it was absolutely required if a sex act was going to produce a baby. As an idea, this turns up in a host of medieval texts, from the 13th century onwards.
[(A Brief History Of The Female Orgasm, From Medieval To Modern Times)](https://www.bustle.com/articles/66678-a-brief-history-of-the-female-orgasm-from-medieval-to-modern-times).  







&amp;nbsp;





At first I was like *damn, I wish I could go back in time and become a medieval surrogate*. 75-80% of women cannot orgasm from penetration alone, so I assumed this meant Medieval-era men ate a lot of p**** back in the day.  But then I found out that oral sex was outlawed by the Church at the time.  








&gt; Marital sexual activity had to be intended to be procreative, so certain heterosexual non-procreative positions were outlawed (sex standing up, penetration from behind, woman on top), as were oral sex and anal sex even between husband and wife in a marriage. 
[(Medieval Sex and Sexuality)](https://www.historychannel.com.au/articles/medieval-sex-and-sexuality/).  







&amp;nbsp;



**If couples in the Middle Ages were only having vaginal sex (in the missionary position, no less) to conceive, how is it possible that both parties were reaching orgasm every time?**  







Humans obviously did not go extinct in the 1300\'s, which means there must have been some justification at the time for how these women were able to get pregnant. If anyone could enlighten me about medieval sex and/or the origin of these rumors, it would be much appreciated. How seriously was the oral sex prohibition really taken?  







---





**TL;DR - If people in the Middle Ages commonly believed that women needed to orgasm in order to become pregnant, but oral sex was taboo/illegal at the time: were women *actually* orgasming during sex as much as their husbands and male doctors believed?**  ',

As a woman (22F) I get self-conscious about receiving oral sex if I haven&amp;#39;t showered in a few hours, let alone days or weeks.  I can only imagine how unbearable it would have been to perform cunnilingus back before women were regularly bathing. Therefore, I was surprised to read that back in the Middle Ages, it was widely believed that in order to conceive a baby, &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; parties must reach orgasm.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what you may be getting from medieval romance novels, the medieval scientific theory of sexual reproduction had a pretty strong role for the lady&amp;#39;s orgasm. Namely, they thought it was absolutely required if a sex act was going to produce a baby. As an idea, this turns up in a host of medieval texts, from the 13th century onwards.
&lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/66678-a-brief-history-of-the-female-orgasm-from-medieval-to-modern-times"&gt;(A Brief History Of The Female Orgasm, From Medieval To Modern Times)&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I was like &lt;em&gt;damn, I wish I could go back in time and become a medieval surrogate&lt;/em&gt;. 75-80% of women cannot orgasm from penetration alone, so I assumed this meant Medieval-era men ate a lot of p**** back in the day.  But then I found out that oral sex was outlawed by the Church at the time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marital sexual activity had to be intended to be procreative, so certain heterosexual non-procreative positions were outlawed (sex standing up, penetration from behind, woman on top), as were oral sex and anal sex even between husband and wife in a marriage. 
&lt;a href="https://www.historychannel.com.au/articles/medieval-sex-and-sexuality/"&gt;(Medieval Sex and Sexuality)&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If couples in the Middle Ages were only having vaginal sex (in the missionary position, no less) to conceive, how is it possible that both parties were reaching orgasm every time?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans obviously did not go extinct in the 1300&amp;#39;s, which means there must have been some justification at the time for how these women were able to get pregnant. If anyone could enlighten me about medieval sex and/or the origin of these rumors, it would be much appreciated. How seriously was the oral sex prohibition really taken?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR - If people in the Middle Ages commonly believed that women needed to orgasm in order to become pregnant, but oral sex was taboo/illegal at the time: were women &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; orgasming during sex as much as their husbands and male doctors believed?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

I learned that at least among Jews it used to be different than it is today, the current form arising from Talmudic times: "Much later in the Hellenic period, about 140 C.E., the Jewish authorities modified circumcision procedure to make it impossible for a Jew to appear to be an uncircumcised Greek. A radical new procedure called peri\'ah was introduced by the priests and rabbis. In this procedure the foreskin was stripped away from the glans, with which it is fused in the infant. In a painful procedure known today as a synechotomy, more foreskin was removed than before and the injury was correspondingly greater. With the introduction of peri\'ah, the glans could not easily be recovered, and so no Jewish male would easily be able to appear as an uncircumcised Greek. This radical modified procedure eventually was adopted by the medical profession and is the circumcision operation used today" (http://www.cirp.org/library/history).

This is along the lines of those who pose that Biblical circumcision comprised the removal of the tip of the foreskin only, in this way not exposing the glans in its entirety.

Having discarded the supposed health benefits, some people argue it is mainly an identitary mark, a tribal practice which is to be considered only as a signal of community membership and nothing else (https://reformjudaism.org/why-reform-never-abandoned-circumcision). But this only makes sense in the case of peri\'ah (modern circumcision), because as stated in the CIRP article it was very difficult to tell a Greek foreskin from a Jewish foreskin in pre-Talmudic times.

One of the first things that came to mind was that it was an initiation rite into adulthood, as it happens nowadays in some Nigerian tribes. But this also would not suffice to explain why Abraham was circumcised at 99 years of age (Genesis 17:9). In a purely speculative way I ventured that in a tribalistic mentality adult men would perceive menstruating teenage girls as having been "damaged" by adult women, and from that they would infer they should do the same to boys, if one wishes to remain within the boundaries of initiation explanatory logic.

But at the end of the day the question remains unpolluted. Peri\'ah seems to be a reasonable group differentiation, but what about what was apparently the original circumcision, the milah?

Thanks in advance.',

The answers explained how America had very strict laws against crossdressing in the 19th century.

Now, Britain has a tradition of comedic cross-dressing, mostly associated with the working class (but not entirely). One of our traditional forms of entertainment is the Pantomine, which has a number of stock characters, including the young, fresh-faced, male hero (played by a girl) and the Dame, a middle-aged woman who produces a lot of innuendo (and is traditionally played by a man; not a delicate feminine man, but a really big, butch man).

I\'ve seen pictures of my grandfather and his friends singing in drag at their working-man\'s club, and there\'s no implication that this makes them LGBT (and I suspect the imprecation would be treated with violence). I read my great-grandfather\'s diary of his journey to China in 1910, and on the ship the British guests had a costume party. He (a 22-year old man) dressed as a woman, and everyone thought it was "jolly funny". He didn\'t seem at all to consider that people might think he was LGBT. Even today, my uncle dresses in drag to raise money for charity.

I\'m not saying that seeing cross-dressing as funny isn\'t transphobic; I\'m just interested as to a)why Americans were so much more worried about it, that they had laws against it, and b)how this British tradition of comedic cross-dressing fed into more modern views of transvestites, including those who take cross-dressing more seriously as part of their identity? Is there a link between traditional Pantomine dames and modern Drag Queens, for example?

Edit: Another poster PMed me and asked if I actually meant how did British attitudes to comedic cross-dressing affect our view of transexuals, since surely cross-dressing is what transvestites are about; I didn\'t, actually, because I doubt it has had a big effect (though if anyone wants to argue that, feel free). I meant transvestites, as in men who wear women\'s clothes because it feels right to them, but don\'t consider themselves to be a woman or want to get gender reassignment surgery; this is not the same as men dressing up as women in a show for laughs, but I wonder if the acceptability of the second has affected the evolution of British attitudes to the first in a different way to America\'s (positively or negatively)... or not really.',
